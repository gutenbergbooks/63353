<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
THE CABLE FROM HUGH'S UNCLE
</h3>

<p>
The messenger was peering at the card above the
push-button beside the apartment entrance as I
came up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Chesby?" he said laconically, extending a pink
envelope.
</p>

<p>
"He lives here," I answered.  "I'll sign for it."
</p>

<p>
The boy clumped off downstairs, and I let myself in,
never dreaming that I held the key to destiny in my
hand&mdash;or, rather, in the pink envelope.
</p>

<p>
A samovar was bubbling in the studio, and my cousin
Betty King hailed me from the couch on which she sat
between her father and Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are at last," she cried.  "Dad and I have
come to say good-by to you."
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" I asked.  "Can't you stand
Hugh any longer?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh glowered at me.
</p>

<p>
"Always raggin'," he commented.
</p>

<p>
Betty laughed.
</p>

<p>
"We are going to Constantinople to hunt for Greek
manuscripts."
</p>

<p>
"I have a theory," explained my uncle, Vernon King,
"that the upheavals of the war and the occupation of the
city by Christian garrisons should be productive of rich
opportunities for bibliophiles like myself, aside from an
enhanced chance for archæological research."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I wish you luck," I grumbled.  "And I wish
I was not tied down to an architect's drawing-board."
</p>

<p>
"'Matter of fact, I'm about fed up with Wall Street,"
growled Hugh.  "Nobody can make money any more."
</p>

<p>
"It's very funny," remarked Betty.  "Both you and
Jack announced when you settled down after the war,
Hugh, that nothing could ever root you up again.  All
you wanted, you said, was a good job and plenty of hard
work."
</p>

<p>
"I know it," admitted Hugh.  "I remember Nash, here,
and Nikka Zaranko&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You mean the famous Gypsy violinist?" interrupted
my uncle, who, I ought to say, uses the millions he receives
from his oil-holdings to patronize the arts and sciences.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  He was in the Foreign Legion durin' the
war.  We all met in the last big push in Flanders.  I
went in with my battalion to help out Jack's crowd, and
was snowed under with them.  Then Nikka tried to extricate
both outfits, and the upshot was the Aussies finally
turned the trick.  Some show!
</p>

<p>
"Well, we three became pals.  What I was going to
say was that the last time we got together before
demobilization we agreed we never wanted to feel the threat of
danger again.  We wanted to become rich and prosperous
and fat and contented.  That was why I came over to
New York with Jack, instead of staying home and
fighting with my uncle."
</p>

<p>
"That reminds me," I said, extending the pink envelope.
"Here's a cable for you.  Maybe&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If it's from Uncle James I shall be surprised," replied
Hugh, ripping open the envelope.  "A line once in six
months is his idea of avuncular correspondence.  Hullo!"
</p>

<p>
He pursed his lips in a prolonged whistle.
</p>

<p>
"Anything wrong?" asked Betty anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;well&mdash;humph!  It's hard to say.  Listen to this:
'Sailing <i>Aquitania</i> to-day due New York eighteenth must
see you immediately have made important discovery your
aid essential family fortunes involved this confidential."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, on second thought, it is wrong, all wrong.  He's
after that treasure again.  Oh, lord!  I did my best to
persuade him to be sensible before I left England with
Jack."
</p>

<p>
"A treasure!" exclaimed Betty.  "But you never told
me about it!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's a long story," protested Hugh.  "Frightfully
boring.  It's a sort of family curse&mdash;like leprosy or
housemaid's knee.  It's supposed to be located in
Constantinople, and my uncle has spent his life and most of the
family's property trying to find it.  That's why I have
to make money in New York instead of playing the
country gentleman.  There was little enough in the family
treasury before Uncle James reached it.  Now&mdash;  Well, the
new Lord, who will probably be me, will find trouble
paying the Herald's fees, let alone succession duties."
</p>

<p>
"You really are too exasperating," declared Betty.
"A treasure story is never boring."
</p>

<p>
"I am on Betty's side," said her father.
</p>

<p>
My uncle Vernon is a very decent sort, despite the fact
that he is a millionaire.  He is a professor several times
over, and hates the title.  And he is one of the few learned
men I know who can be genuinely interested in low-brow
diversions.
</p>

<p>
"So am I," I said, backing him up.  "You have been
guilty of secrecy with your friends, which is an English
vice I thought I had broken you of, Hugh.  Come
clean!"
</p>

<p>
"But there's so little to tell," he said.  "I had an
ancestor about seven hundred years ago, who is generally
called Hugh the First.  This Hugh was son to Lord James,
who went to the Crusades and was a famous character in
his time.  On his way to Palestine, the stories say, James
stayed a while with the Emperor Andronicus, who ruled
in the Eastern Empire&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes," interrupted King eagerly, "would that have
been Andronicus Comnenus, sometimes called The
Butcher?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe so, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very interesting," nodded King.  "Andronicus
amassed a great wealth through fines and exactions from
the nobles, so the contemporary chronicles tell us."
</p>

<p>
"And this treasure is supposed to be in Constantinople!"
exploded Betty.  "Where we are going!  Isn't
that so, Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is always located in Constantinople,"
answered Hugh.  "In fact, it is generally referred to as
the Treasure of the Bucoleon, which, I understand from
Uncle James and other authorities of my university days,
was the principal palace of the Eastern Emperors."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right," agreed Vernon King, his scholar's
interest whipped aflame.  "It was a magnificent residence,
vying with the Palace of the Cæsars in Rome.  In reality,
in light of modern antiquarian research, we may describe
it as a group of noble structures, standing isolated from
the city within a spacious park, surrounded by an
independent series of fortifications and with its own naval
harbor on the Bosphorus."
</p>

<p>
"An extensive area to hunt over for an apocryphal
treasure," remarked Hugh drily.
</p>

<p>
"You may well say so," endorsed my uncle.  "I have
been in Constantinople for extended periods upon several
occasions, and I have never satisfied myself as to the
existence at this time of any bone fide portions of the
Bucoleon, although it is difficult to pronounce definitely on
this point.  The older portions of the city, especially those
most massively constructed, have been so over-built since
the Turkish conquest that frequently what is ostensibly
a relatively modern building turns out to be almost
unbelieveably ancient at the core.  But the prejudices of
the Turks and their distaste for foreign&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Betty, chewing her finger with impatience, waved to her
father to be silent.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy!" she exclaimed.  "Really, you aren't lecturing,
you know!  Do let Hugh get on with the treasure."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm afraid I've gotten as far as I can," replied
Hugh.  "The tradition simply says that Andronicus
confided the secret of the location of the treasure to Lord
James.  Then Andronicus was assassinated, and James was
thrown into prison by his successor.  Hugh, James's son,
went to Constantinople with an army of Latin Crusaders
who had decided that the best way to help the Holy Land
was to establish a friendly base there.  They conquered
the city&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A remarkable venture," corroborated my uncle.  "The
ease with which they secured possession of a city of one
million inhabitants, not to speak of an extensive empire,
is a clear indication of the degeneracy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Betty clapped her hand over his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Do get on, Hugh!" she begged.  "The treasure!
You're almost as long-winded as Dad."
</p>

<p>
We all laughed, and yet, indefinably, she had communicated
to each of us something of the magic spell which
is conveyed by any hint of treasure hidden in the past.
We savored the heady wine of danger.  I felt my right
palm itching for the corrugated rubber butt of an
automatic.  When Hugh continued his story we all leaned
forward, flushed and tense.
</p>

<p>
"The Crusaders captured the city, and Hugh rescued
his father.  Then they returned to England.  Before
James died he passed on the secret of the treasure to
Hugh.  There are documents in the Charter Chest&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" demanded Betty.
</p>

<p>
"It's a terribly old oaken box, bound with copper and
steel," explained Hugh.  "We keep it in a safe deposit
vault in the City&mdash;London, you know.  These documents
say that James's idea was to have the treasure used for
the rehabilitation of Christendom if any cause arose which
would justify such a gift.  Failing that, the money was to
go to his descendants.  But for many generations the
Lords of Chesby were too busy to hunt treasure so far
from home.
</p>

<p>
"One Lord tried for it in Harry the Fifth's time,
but the Greeks watched him so closely that he thought
himself lucky to escape from Constantinople with his life.
Then the Turks captured the city, and after that it was
too risky&mdash;except for one chap in Elizabeth's reign.  He
was Lord James, the sixteenth baron, a shipmate of Raleigh
and Drake and Hawkins, and he feared nothing that
lived.  He put in at Constantinople and bearded the
Grand Turk in his lair.  But even he did not venture to
make a genuine search in view of the conditions that
prevailed.  From his time on few of the family bothered with
the tradition until Uncle James commenced to mortgage
farms to finance his researches."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have no definite knowledge of the location
of the treasure?" asked King.  "No chart or&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hugh laughed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, that is just why I feel so peevish over the way
Uncle James has devastated the estate.  It's a search for
a needle in a haystack&mdash;and a needle that in all probability
never existed, at that."
</p>

<p>
"I fear so," assented King, shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" said Betty.  "It's as good a treasure story
as I ever read.  Why shouldn't it be true?  Could you
imagine a more perfect place for concealing a treasure all
these centuries than Constantinople?"
</p>

<p>
"Your father will tell you," retorted Hugh scornfully,
"that there is not a famous ruin in the Near East but is
declared to contain a treasure of one kind or another."
</p>

<p>
"True&mdash;only too true!" agreed King.
</p>

<p>
"The sole use of the legend so far," continued Hugh
unhappily, "has been to give Uncle James something to
do.  It must be a godsend to Curzon in managing the
House, for during the war while Uncle James was shut up
in England he was continually moving for the appointment
of committees to preserve the monumental brasses
of country churches and appealing to the government to
recognize that England owed a duty to civilization in
retaining and Christianizing Constantinople&mdash;so he could
dig to his heart's content for the treasure."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I for one intend to believe in it," stated Betty,
"and if your uncle wants any help in hunting for it, he
can count on me."
</p>

<p>
"We'll all help him, if it comes to that," I said.
"Nikka Zaranko would never forgive us if we left him out
of such a party."
</p>

<p>
"Uncle James will have nothing tangible to go on," said
Hugh.  "You can stake your last shilling on that.  He's
never had a sane idea yet."
</p>

<p>
"I take it, then," remarked Betty, rising with a
detached air, "that you have no desire to go to
Constantinople."
</p>

<p>
Betty is slim, with brown hair and eyes and a face
that you have to look at and when she sets her head
back&mdash;  But of course I am only her cousin.  Hugh jumped
up, nervously crunching the cable in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"If I only do get a decent excuse to go to Constantinople!"
he exclaimed.  "But there's no use.  I won't,
Bet.  I couldn't honestly encourage Uncle James in any
more foolishness."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," suggested King, "his visit has nothing to do
with the treasure."
</p>

<p>
Hugh chuckled, his merry self again.
</p>

<p>
"Cross the Atlantic just to look me up?  Not a chance,
sir.  His ruling passion is driving him on.  Confound it,
though!  I wish this hadn't come up.  And I wish I didn't
crave adventure again.  And I wish you weren't going to
Constantinople.  All right!  Laugh, Jack, curse you!
Laugh!  Here, I'll scrag you with a couch-pillow!"
</p>

<p>
"Easy!  Easy!" I pleaded.  "For the furniture's sake!
How about giving the Kings a line to Nikka in Paris or
wherever he is?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Betty, "but we're going via the
Mediterranean.  The best thing for you boys to do is to pack up
with Hugh's uncle, collect your friend Nikka en route and
follow on."
</p>

<p>
"No go," answered Hugh dismally.  "All I am
scheduled for is a fat family row."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
THE BROKEN MESSAGE
</h3>

<p>
The steamship company telephoned while Hugh
and I were at breakfast to say that the <i>Aquitania</i>
was just docking.  When we reached the pier
West Street was swarming with out-going automobiles
loaded with the first contingents of debarking passengers.
We pushed our way upstairs into the landing-shed,
surrendered our passes and dived into the swirling vortex
of harried travelers, hysterical relatives and impassive
Custom's officials.
</p>

<p>
The Purser's office in the Main Saloon was vacant, but
Hugh buttonholed a passing steward.
</p>

<p>
"Lord Chesby, sir?  Yes, sir, he was one of the first
ashore.  There was a gentleman to meet him, I think, sir."
</p>

<p>
"That's queer," muttered Hugh as we returned to the
gangway.
</p>

<p>
"Our best bet is to go straight to the C space in the
Customs lines," I said.
</p>

<p>
"But who could meet him besides us?" objected Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"It's damned queer," I agreed.  "What does your
uncle look like?"
</p>

<p>
"He's small, stocky, not fat.  Must be around sixty,"
said Hugh vaguely.
</p>

<p>
We surveyed the space under the letter C, where porters
were dumping trunks and bags and passengers were
arguing with the inspectors.
</p>

<p>
"No, he's not here," said Hugh.  "Wait, though, there's
Watkins!"
</p>

<p>
"Who's Watkins?" I asked, boring a passage beside
him through the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"He's Uncle James's man."
</p>

<p>
Watkins was the replica of Hugh's description of his
uncle.  He was a chunky, solid sort of man, with the
masklike face of the trained English servant.  He was
clean-shaven, and dressed neatly in a dark suit and felt
hat.  When we came upon him he was sitting forlornly on
a pile of baggage, watching the confusion around him.
with a disapproving eye.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Watty?" Hugh greeted him.  "Where's my
uncle?"
</p>

<p>
The valet's features lighted up, and he scrambled to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mister Hugh!  I'm very glad to see you, sir, if
I may say so.  "Is ludship, sir?  Why, 'e went off with
your messenger, sir."
</p>

<p>
"My messenger?" Hugh repeated blankly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, the dark gentleman.  Your man, 'e said 'e
was, sir."
</p>

<p>
"My man!" Hugh appealed to me.  "Did you hear
that, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
Watkins became suddenly anxious.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing wrong, I 'ope, sir?  The gentleman
came aboard to find us, and told 'is ludship how you'd
been delayed, and 'e was to come along to your rooms,
sir, whilst I saw the luggage through the Customs.  Wasn't
that right, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh sat down on a trunk.
</p>

<p>
"It's right enough, Watty," he groaned, "except that
I never sent such a message and I haven't a man."
</p>

<p>
"What sort of fellow was this messenger?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Watkins turned to me, a look of bewilderment in his
face.
</p>

<p>
"An Eastern-looking gentleman, 'e was, sir, like the
Gypsies 'is ludship occasionally 'as down to Chesby.
Strange, I thought it, sir, Mister Hugh, that you should
be 'aving a gentleman like that to valet you&mdash;but as I
said to 'is ludship, likely it's not easy to find servants in
America."
</p>

<p>
"How long ago did Uncle James leave, Watty?" asked
Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly an hour, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Time enough for him to have reached the apartment.
Jack, do you mind telephoning on the off-chance?  I'll
fetch an inspector to go over this stuff."
</p>

<p>
I had no difficulty in getting the apartment.  The
cleaning woman who "did" for us answered.  No, nobody had
called, and there had been no telephone messages.  I
hastened back to the C space with a sense of ugly forebodings.
Hugh I found colloguing with Watkins, while two Customs
men opened the pile of Lord Chesby's baggage.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Jack," said Hugh seriously, "I am
beginning to think that something sinister may have
happened?  Watty tells me that he and Uncle James are just
come from Constantinople.  He says my uncle went there
convinced that he had discovered the key to the treasure's
hiding-place, but in some unexplained way Uncle James
was deterred from carrying out his plans, and they
returned hurriedly to England."
</p>

<p>
"And now I think of it, sir," amended Watkins, "we
'ave been shadowed ever since we went to Turkey.  I
never paid much attention to them, considering it was
coincidence like, but its been one dark gentleman after
another&mdash;at the Pera Palace Hotel in Constantinople, on the
Orient Express, in London when we called on 'is ludship's
solicitors&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What was that for?" interrupted Hugh&mdash;and to me:
"Uncle James hated business.  He couldn't be brought to
any kind of business interview unless he had a pressing
motive."
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, Mister Hugh, I don't know rightly&mdash;leastways,
'twas after 'is conversation with Mr. Bellowes 'e
sent the cablegram to you, sir.  And 'e 'ad the Charter
Chest sent up from the safe deposit vaults&mdash;but that was
before we went to Turkey, to be sure, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"It was, eh?"  Hugh was all interest.  "How was
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, 'e rang for me one day at Chesby, and 'e
was rubbin' 'is 'ands together like he does when 'e's
pleased, and 'e said: 'Watkins, pack the small wardrobe
and the portmanteau.  We're goin' to run down to
Constantinople.'  'Yes, sir,' I said, 'and do we go direct to
Dover?'  'No,' 'e said, 'we'll go up to London.  Wire
Mr. Bellowes to 'ave the Charter Chest sent up from the
bank.  I must 'ave another look at it&mdash;' 'e was talkin' to
himself like, sir&mdash;'I wonder if the hint might not 'ave
been in the Instructions, after all.'"
</p>

<p>
Hugh jumped.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, he has been after the treasure!  The
Instructions is the original parchment on which Hugh the
First inscribed his command to his son to go after the
treasure&mdash;carefully leaving out, however, the directions
for finding it.  And what happened then, Watty?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, we went up to London, and Mr. Bellowes, 'e
tried to persuade 'is ludship not to go.  They were
together 'alf the morning, and when they came from the
private office I 'eard Mr. Bellowes say: 'I'm afraid I can't
follow your ludship.  There's not a word in the Instructions
or any of the other documents to shed a ray of light
on the matter.'  'That's what I wished to make sure of,
Bellowes,' said 'is ludship, with a chuckle."
</p>

<p>
"Cryptic, to put it mildly," barked Hugh.  "Dammit,
I knew the old boy was up to some foolishness.  If he's
taken on some giddy crew of crooks for a piratical
venture&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't have called on you for help," I cut him
off.
</p>

<p>
"True," assented Hugh.  "But I wish I could take
some stock in the nonsense at the bottom of it."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder!" I said.  "I'm drifting to Betty's belief
that there is more in the treasure story than you think."
</p>

<p>
"It's bunk, I tell you," said Hugh, thoroughly disgusted.
"Well, the Customs men are through.  Watty, collect some
porters, and get this baggage down to the taxi stand."
</p>

<p>
The cleaning-woman was still in the apartment when we
returned, and she reiterated her assertion that nobody had
called.  We had some lunch, and then, on Watkins's
suggestion, I rang up hotels for two hours&mdash;without any
result.  At the end of my tether I hung up the receiver and
joined Hugh in gloomy reflection on the couch.  Watkins
hovered disconsolately in the adjoining dining room.
</p>

<p>
"There's one thing more to do," said Hugh suddenly.
"Telephone the police."
</p>

<p>
"That would involve publicity," I pointed out.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be helped."
</p>

<p>
The telephone jangled harshly as he spoke, and I unhooked
the receiver.  Hugh started to his feet.  Watkins
entered noiselessly.
</p>

<p>
"Is this Mr. Chesby's apartment?"  The voice that
burred in my ear was strangely thick, with a guttural
intonation.  "Tell him they are taking what's left of his
uncle to Bellevue.  It's his own fault the old fool got it.
And you can tell his nephew we will feed him a dose of the
same medicine if he doesn't come across."
</p>

<p>
Brr-rring!
</p>

<p>
"Wait!  Wait!" I gasped into the mouthpiece.
"Who&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Number, please," said a stilted feminine voice.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" I cried.  "Hugh, they've killed him, I
think."
</p>

<p>
Hugh's face went white as I repeated the message.
Watkins' eyes popped from his head.
</p>

<p>
"Where is this hospital?" stammered Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Over on the East Side."
</p>

<p>
"We must catch a taxi.  Hurry!"
</p>

<p>
Watkins came with us without bidding.  In the taxi
none of us spoke.  We were all dazed.  Things had
happened too rapidly for comprehension.  We could scarcely
realize that we were confronting stark tragedy.  As we
turned into East Twenty-sixth Street and the portals
of the huge, red-brick group of buildings loomed ahead
of us, Hugh exclaimed fiercely:
</p>

<p>
"It may not be true!  I believe it was a lie!"
</p>

<p>
But it was not a lie, as we soon learned in the office
to which we were ushered by a white-uniformed orderly.
Yes, the nurse on duty told us, an ambulance had brought
in an elderly man such as Hugh described within the
half-hour.  The orderly would show us the ward.
</p>

<p>
We traversed a maze of passages to a curtained doorway
where a young surgeon, immaculate in white, awaited us.
</p>

<p>
"You want to see the old man who has been stabbed?"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Hugh gripped my arm.
</p>

<p>
"Stabbed!  Is he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The surgeon nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He must have made a hell of a fight.  He's all
slashed up&mdash;too old to stand the shock."
</p>

<p>
Watkins caught his breath sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, he may not be your man," the surgeon added
soothingly.  "This way."
</p>

<p>
He led us into a long room lined with beds.  A high
screen had been reared around one of them, and he drew it
aside and motioned for us to enter.  An older surgeon
stood by the head of the narrow bed with a hypodermic
needle in his hand.  Opposite him kneeled a nurse.  Two
bulky men in plainclothes, obvious policemen, stood at the
foot.
</p>

<p>
And against the pillow lay a head that might have been
Hugh's, frosted and lined by the years.  The gray hair
grew in the same even way as Hugh's.  The hawk-nose,
the deep-set eyes, the stubborn jaw, the close-clipped
mustache, the small ears, were all the same.  As we entered,
the eyes flashed open an instant, then closed.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle James!"
</p>

<p>
"'Is ludship!  Oh, Gawd!"
</p>

<p>
The policemen and the nurse eyed us curiously, but the
surgeon by the bed kept his attention concentrated on the
wan cheeks of the inert figure, fingers pressing lightly on
the pulse of a hand that lay outside the sheets.  Swiftly he
stooped, with a low ejaculation to the nurse.  She swabbed
the figure's arm with a dab of cotton, and the needle was
driven home.
</p>

<p>
"Caught him up in time," remarked the surgeon impartially.
"Best leave him while it acts."
</p>

<p>
He turned to us.
</p>

<p>
"I take it you recognize him, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"He is my uncle," answered Hugh dully.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I fancy you will be able to secure a few words
with him after the strychnia has taken hold, but he is
slipping fast."
</p>

<p>
One of the policemen stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
"I am from the Detective Bureau," he said.  "Do you
know how this happened?"
</p>

<p>
"We know nothing," returned Hugh.  "He landed from
the <i>Aquitania</i> this morning.  We were late in reaching the
pier.  When we reached it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Some instinct prompted me to step on Hugh's foot.  He
understood, hesitated and shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;he was gone, ostensibly to seek my apartment."
</p>

<p>
"Name?" asked the detective, thumbing a notebook.
</p>

<p>
"His?  Chesby.  It is mine, too."
</p>

<p>
"Initials?"
</p>

<p>
"His full name is James Hubert Chetwynd Crankhaugh Chesby."
</p>

<p>
"English?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Business or profession?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know how to answer that question.  He is
a scholar&mdash;and then he's a member of the House of Lords."
</p>

<p>
A subtle change swept over the faces of the policemen.
They became absurdly deferential.  Their interest, which
had been perfunctory, grew intent.  The surgeons and the
nurse, hardened to such deathbed scenes, responded also
to the element of drama which Hugh's words had injected
into the drab story.
</p>

<p>
"Gee-roosalum!" exclaimed the policeman.  "This
begins to look big.  Who could have wanted to bump off
a guy like him?  Was he&mdash;a gay sorter old boy, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Positively, no.  He was the last man to suspect of
anything like that.  He has been a traveler and student
all his life."
</p>

<p>
"What was his specialty?"
</p>

<p>
"Gypsy dialects and history, and the ancient history of
Constantinople.'
</p>

<p>
"Gypsies, eh?"  The detective was all alert.  "He was
picked up corner of Thirteenth Street and Avenue C.
There's a plenty of Gypsy dumps in that neighborhood.  A
man and three women saw him dropped from a closed
auto.  The Gyps are a bad people to get down on you,
clannish as hell and awful suspicious.  It may be this here
Lord Chesby crossed some family of 'em in his studying
and they went out to knife him.'
</p>

<p>
"It may be," agreed Hugh, "but I haven't a thing to
back up the assertion with."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll start to work on that clue anyhow."
</p>

<p>
The detective stepped around the screen, and Hugh
touched the senior surgeon on the arm.
</p>

<p>
"How long?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably only a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, the deep-sunk eyes flickered open,
surveyed us almost quizzically one by one.
</p>

<p>
Hugh bent forward, Watkins beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know me, Uncle James?"
</p>

<p>
The lips parted, framed words that were barely audible.
</p>

<p>
"Good lad!  Where's&mdash;Watkins?"
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, your ludship," volunteered the valet, with a
gulp.
</p>

<p>
"Send&mdash;others&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hugh looked up to the senior surgeon.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  Just a moment, though."
</p>

<p>
He stooped to feel the pulse, reached for the needle
and shot in a second injection.  Its effect was instantaneous.
The dying man's eyes brightened; a very faint tinge
of color glowed in his ashen face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid that second shot will hasten the end," the
surgeon muttered to me, "but it will give the poor old
fellow more strength while he lasts.  Make the most of
your opportunity."
</p>

<p>
He shepherded his assistants outside the screen, and
Hugh pulled me to my knees beside him.
</p>

<p>
"This is Jack Nash, Uncle James," he said, speaking
slowly and distinctly.  "He is my friend&mdash;your friend.
He will be with me in whatever I have to do for you."
</p>

<p>
Lord Chesby's eyes, a clear gray they were, examined me
closely.
</p>

<p>
"Looks&mdash;right."  The syllables trickled almost soundless
from his lips.  "It's&mdash;treasure&mdash;Hugh."  His eyes
burned momentarily with triumph.  "Know&mdash;where&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But who stabbed you?"
</p>

<p>
I have often wondered what would have happened if
Hugh had let him talk on of the treasure, instead of
switching the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Toutou," answered the dying man, with sudden
strength.  "Tiger&mdash;that chap&mdash;others&mdash;against&mdash;him."
</p>

<p>
"But why?  Why did he do it?"
</p>

<p>
Once more the smile of triumph in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't&mdash;tell&mdash;him&mdash;treasure&mdash;said&mdash;torture&mdash;broke&mdash;away&mdash;Gypsies&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Exhaustion overcame him.  His eyes closed.
</p>

<p>
"Is he going?" I murmured.
</p>

<p>
Hugh crouched lower and held his watch-case to the
blue lips.  A mist clouded the polished surface.
</p>

<p>
"Give him time," he said.  "Watty, who is Teuton!"
</p>

<p>
"Never 'eard of 'im, sir.  Oh; Mister Hugh, sir, is 'is
ludship&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The gray eyes opened; the lips began to move.
</p>

<p>
"Watch&mdash;out&mdash;that&mdash;gang&mdash;desperate&mdash;be&mdash;after&mdash;you."
</p>

<p>
"But who are they, Uncle James?"
</p>

<p>
"Toutou&mdash;worst&mdash;Beran&mdash;many&mdash;bad&mdash;lot."
</p>

<p>
"Where did they take you?  Tell us, and we shall have
them arrested?"
</p>

<p>
The gray eyes glittered.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no&mdash;lad&mdash;avoid&mdash;police&mdash;don't&mdash;talk&mdash;treasure&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where is the treasure?" I interposed.
</p>

<p>
"Bull&mdash;cedars&mdash;li&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His breathing dwindled to little, fluttering gasps, but
he fought on.
</p>

<p>
"How did you find it, Uncle James?" asked Hugh
softly.
</p>

<p>
That gay smile of triumph shone in his eyes for the last
time.
</p>

<p>
"Used&mdash;my&mdash;brain&mdash;all&mdash;laughed&mdash;me&mdash;in&mdash;Hugh's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And the life flickered out of him as we watched.
</p>

<p>
Two big tears rolled down Watkins' cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"'E was a good master.  Oh, Mister Hugh, sir, I do
hope we can punish those bloody villains!"
</p>

<p>
"We will," said Hugh coldly, rising to his feet.  "For
the time being, Watkins, remember to keep your mouth
shut about all this.  Uncle James was right about the
police.  They can't help us in such a matter.  If there
is anything in the treasure story we should wreck any
chance of finding it by advertising our purpose."
</p>

<p>
"The less said the better," I agreed.  "If the police
ask us, he rambled at the end about Gypsies and family
affairs."
</p>

<p>
There were several details to be settled with the
hospital authorities.  The British Consulate had to be
notified.  Reporters had to be seen.  It was early evening
when the three of us returned to the apartment in West
Eleventh Street, and the newsboys were yelling an extra.
</p>

<p>
"English nobleman murdered on the East Side!  Horrible
death of Lord Chesby!"
</p>

<p>
I bought a copy, and we read it as we walked down
Fifth Avenue:
</p>

<p>
"'One of the strangest murder mysteries in the criminal
annals of New York has been presented to the police for
solution through the death in Bellevue Hospital this
afternoon of James Hubert Chetwynd Crankhaugh Chesby,
twenty-ninth Baron Chesby in the Peerage of Great
Britain, thirty-fifth Lord of the Manor of Chesby and
Hereditary Ranger of Crowden Forest.
</p>

<p>
"'After landing from the Cunarder <i>Aquitania</i> this
morning, Lord Chesby, a dignified, scholarly man of
fifty-eight, was lured away from the pier into the purlieus of
the East Side, where, apparently after a valiant fight for
life, he was set upon and hacked with knives.  His body,
still living, was left by an automobile&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Skip it," ordered Hugh impatiently.  "What do they
say of the object of the crime?"
</p>

<p>
"'From the fact that Lord Chesby has made a life-long
study of Gypsy lore and dialects,' I read on, 'the police
suspect that some criminal of these nomad tribes may have
slain the distinguished nobleman, either for personal gain
or vengeance.  Lord Chesby's nephew and heir, the
Hon. Hugh James Ronald Howard Chesby, who is a Wall Street
bond-broker, received a telephone message during the
afternoon, notifying him of his uncle's fate and warning him
that the same end would be his if he made any attempt
to run down the assassins.'
</p>

<p>
"'The new Lord Chesby when interviewed at&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it," interrupted Hugh again, frowning,
"but it will have to stand.  Uncle James wanted it that
way, and his word is law.  It will do no good to add to
the story.  The police can't help us.  We are playing a
lone hand.  All rules are off."
</p>

<p>
"A lone hand?" I repeated.  "Does that mean that
Nikka is out of it?  Remember, we agreed after the Armistice
that if we ever did forsake the fleshpots for the call
of danger it would be together."
</p>

<p>
"I hate to drag him away from his concerts," answered
Hugh, considering.  "He's makin' pots of money.  But if
there's a Gypsy angle to this he'd be priceless to us."
</p>

<p>
"And he'd never forgive us if we left him out," I added.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he wouldn't.  Tell you what, we'll cable
him to meet us in London at my solicitors' office.  We've
got a long way to go, Jack.  We don't even know who
we have to fight.  As for the treasure&mdash;  Well, I want to
talk to Bellowes first and have a look at the Charter
Chest."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
THE PAPERS IN THE CHARTER CHEST
</h3>

<p>
At Liverpool we wired to Hugh's solicitors for an
appointment that afternoon and dispatched
Watkins direct to Chesby with the body of his late
master.  We arrived at Victoria about four o'clock, and
took a taxi to the offices of Courtenay, Bellowes, Manson
and Courtenay in a smutted old building in Fleet Street
over against the Law Courts.
</p>

<p>
Up two nights of stairs we climbed to a dirty door with
the firm-name straggling across it.  A clerk stepped
forward as we entered, but before he could speak a brown
figure shot out of an inner office, and wrapped Hugh and
me in a jovial hug.  It was Nikka, thinner than we
remembered him, but with the same steady eyes and quiet
smile.  He was abashed by his own enthusiasm and started
to apologize.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad to see you two," he said, "that I forget
it is a time of sadness.  Yet even so it means gladness for
me that I see my friends again.'
</p>

<p>
"It's gladness for all of us," returned Hugh, wringing
his hand, with its delicate, sinewy fingers.
</p>

<p>
"It means something like the old life once more," I
added.  "That is, if you can come, Nikka."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come," he said simply.  "For two years I have
been faithful to my fiddle.  Now, I think, it is time I had
a rest."
</p>

<p>
An elderly gentleman, with gray hair and precise
features, emerged from the inner offices and bowed
deferentially to Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"I trust your lordship is in good health.  If you
remember&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Mr. Bellowes," assented Hugh.  "I remember
you very well.  This is my friend, Mr. Nash.
Mr. Zaranko, I take it, you already know.  Are you at
liberty?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely, sir.  I expected you.  This way, please."
</p>

<p>
And he ushered us into a room where chairs were clustered
about a square table on which reposed a huge, steel-bound
box of very heavy, dark oak.  Mr. Bellowes waved
his hand toward the box.
</p>

<p>
"I trust I anticipated your lordship's wishes.  I
directed the bank to send up the Charter Chest this
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right," said Hugh, "it will simplify our task.
Did my uncle leave any will?"
</p>

<p>
A shadow settled upon Mr. Bellowes' lined face.
</p>

<p>
"There was no need, your lordship.  The estate is
entailed.  The Shipping Bonds, your grandmother's dower,
went before the war.  The mining shares all have been
sold, as well as several smaller blocks of securities.  Aside
from some insurance accruing from your uncle's demise,
there is practically nothing&mdash;oh, a few government bonds
of the war issues, to be sure&mdash;outside of the Chesby lands."
</p>

<p>
He wrung his hands nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mister Hugh&mdash;I beg your pardon, your lordship&mdash;I
don't know what we shall have to do.  The death
duties can scarcely be met.  The insurance will help some,
but I am afraid we must raise another mortgage at a ruinous
rate or else move to break the entail and sell off some
of the farms.  I warned his late lordship again and again
of the harm he was doing, but he would never listen to me."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Uncle James has paid a stiff price for his
efforts," answered Hugh.  "I can't find it in my heart to
take exception to his extravagances after what happened
in New York."
</p>

<p>
The old lawyer looked at us slyly.
</p>

<p>
"Just what did happen, if I may ask, sir?  The reports
in the press were&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"He was murdered by a gang of criminals, who were
trying to obtain from him information which he apparently
believed furnished a clue to this treasure he had been
searching for all his life," returned Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Really, sir?" exclaimed Mr. Bellowes in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you suppose he was killed within a few hours
of landing in a strange city?" countered Hugh.
</p>

<p>
The solicitor hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"If your lordship will permit me to speak quite frankly?
Ah!  Thank you, sir.  I will say, then, that I had fancied
I knew your uncle unusually well, and in light of that
knowledge I would never have fancied him addicted
to&mdash;er&mdash;" he coughed apologetically&mdash;"probably I need not
say any more.  But at any rate it will not be offensive if
I add that in a long course of legal experience I have
never heard of a man of his late lordship's position being
murdered unless&mdash;unless there were circumstances of a
character we may describe off-hand as unsavory."
</p>

<p>
There was a brief silence.
</p>

<p>
"I infer that is the general supposition?" asked Hugh,
rousing himself.
</p>

<p>
"I fear it is, your lordship."
</p>

<p>
"And it is absolutely untrue!" exclaimed Hugh with
energy.  "I know that!  Mr. Nash knows it!  Watkins
knows it!"
</p>

<p>
"Then why not make the facts known?" suggested Mr. Bellowes.
</p>

<p>
"If we did so, we should have a negligible chance of
establishing our point, and we should certainly lose
whatever slight chance there may be of finding the treasure.
I am sure my uncle would have wished us to go after the
treasure at any cost."
</p>

<p>
"The treasure!"  Mr. Bellowes permitted himself a
faint smile of amusement.  "Am I to understand that
your lordship has succumbed to this fatal lure?"
</p>

<p>
"You may understand I am extremely interested in
the possibility of finding it," retorted Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear!" murmured the aged solicitor, genuinely
distressed.  "Surely, you will listen to reason, sir.  This
Fata Morgana&mdash;if I may term it so&mdash;has exercised an
evil influence upon your family time out of mind.  Your
uncle is one of a number of people whose lives have been
cursed by its futile spell.  I do hope you will permit me
to urge you to abandon an attempt which must infallibly
dissipate whatever is left of your estate."
</p>

<p>
"But you tell me that the estate is wrecked in any
case," replied Hugh.  "I do not blame you for one instant
for being skeptical, Mr. Bellowes.  I felt so, myself, until
recent events forced me to the conclusion that there
may&mdash;notice, please, that I say may&mdash;be more to the matter
than I had imagined.
</p>

<p>
"I am anxious to secure your advice, and therefore I
propose that Mr. Nash and I recount for you and
Mr. Zaranko precisely what happened in connection with my
uncle's visit to New York."
</p>

<p>
So we began at the beginning, with the time I found
the messenger boy studying the door-card of our apartment,
and carried the tale through to Lord Chesby's death
in Bellevue.  Mr. Bellowes was visibly shocked.
</p>

<p>
"I had not supposed such criminals existed any longer,"
he said.  "However, let me draw to your attention the
fact that these incidents happened in New York.  They
could never have happened in England."
</p>

<p>
"They might have happened anywhere," interjected
Nikka, speaking for the first time.
</p>

<p>
We turned to him with startled interest.  His face was
very serious as he leaned forward over the table.
</p>

<p>
"In the first place," he continued, "consider this
treasure.  I have always heard of it as the Treasure of the
Bucoleon, but I believe it is also sometimes referred to as
the Treasure of Andronicus."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to say, you, too, have heard of it?" exclaimed
Mr. Bellowes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It is well-known in the Near East.  I am a
Gypsy.  My father before me was Voivode Tzaibidjo, or
King, of the Balkan Gypsies.  Many tales come to my ears,
for, though my people are scattered far and wide and
no longer make pretense of being a nation, they still
honor those who have been their leaders.  I have heard,
for instance, a story that a certain tribe of Gypsies in
Constantinople guard the supposed site of the treasure.
But I do not vouch for the story.
</p>

<p>
"I do, however, vouch for the statement that Lord
Chesby is confronting an organized international band of
criminals with many Gypsy members; and I do not believe
that such a band would waste time on any enterprise
which they did not have good reason to believe would
promise handsome profits."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to say that such a band could operate in
England to-day?" demanded the old lawyer doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"They can, and almost certainly they do.  Crime has
increased since the war, remember.  The removal of national
barriers and the unsettlement of conditions have stimulated
it anew.  I know something of this band.  If it is the one
I have heard of we are menaced by the most intelligent
combination of thieves, murderers and outlaws that ever
acted together."
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about them?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard that they are doing a great deal of
smuggling, and it is in this work that they use the Gypsies
especially.  I have heard, too, of this Toutou you speak
of.  He is usually called Toutou LaFitte, but he has many
other names.  He is said to be a combination of blood-thirsty
monster and intensely clever strategist.  The band
have ramifications in all classes of society, and there are
few countries they do not reach.  I have no doubt, Hugh,
they made arrangements in your uncle's case with some
affiliated criminal organization in America."
</p>

<p>
"Where do you get all this information?" asked Hugh
curiously.
</p>

<p>
"I am a Gypsy," answered Nikka.  "We Gypsies are
really a separate people, and I grieve to say our lower
orders constitute a criminal class.  As it happens, I am
well-known to my people, and many of them come and tell
me what they hear."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you tell this to the police?" demanded
Mr. Bellowes.
</p>

<p>
"What good would it do?  The police would laugh at
me&mdash;and I should be stabbed some dark night as I came
from a concert.  No, I can turn my knowledge to better
use by aiding Lord Chesby in his quest."
</p>

<p>
"It's blame lucky we have Nikka to help us!" I
exclaimed.  "And I'd like to ask him for his candid
opinion on the treasure business."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Nikka slowly.  "I should not like
to raise Hugh's hopes, but&mdash;  Put it this way.  I should
not be surprised if it is true.  Before we go any farther,
let us ascertain the facts we have to go upon."
</p>

<p>
"That is my idea," agreed Hugh.  "Mr. Bellowes, I
gathered from Watkins that my uncle discussed his
discovery with you.  Did he indicate precisely what it
was or where he had found it?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bellowes joined his fingers tip to tip with meticulous
precision.  A thoughtful expression possessed his face.
</p>

<p>
"I might as well admit," he began, "that you have
shaken my judgments in the matter.  The circumstances
narrated are extraordinary.  I am not prepared to endorse
your conclusions, yet&mdash;  Well, that is by the way, your
lordship."
</p>

<p>
"Watkins is correct in his supposition.  Your uncle did
discuss his&mdash;ah&mdash;fancied discovery with me.  Aside from
the fact that he had made it whilst at Chesby&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"At Chesby?" Hugh interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"So I understood.  He came in to see me just before he
started for Constantinople the last time.  I should
describe him as considerably excited.  "By Jove, Bellowes,'
he said, 'do you know, I've found the missing part of
the Instructions?'  I remember I pooh-poohed his claim,
and instead of becoming angry, as he usually did, he
laughed at me.  "Oh, you may doubt,' he said, 'but I am
going to Constantinople, and I shall soon know whether
I am correct or not.'
</p>

<p>
"'You have been to Constantinople before,' I told him,
'but you never obtained any information.'  'I lacked the
key,' was his answer.  'To think that all these years
nobody ever found it!'  I ventured to remind him of a
mortgage coming due, which could be extended only at an
increased rate, and he replied: 'We'll attend to that without
any difficulty.  I tell you, Bellowes, it's all perfectly
plain in the missing half of the Instructions.'  Then he
had me get out the Charter Chest, saying he wished to go
over the known half of the Instructions to see if there had
not been a hint of the hiding-place in that or any of the
other old documents."
</p>

<p>
"Was there?" questioned Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"If there was, he did not tell me, your lordship.  He
went away without any comment, and the next I saw of
him was perhaps three weeks later when he returned from
Constantinople.  He was even more excited than he had
been when he came up from Chesby.  "I really think there's
something in it,' he said.  "I wish you'd have one of your
young men send this cable to my nephew.  I am going to
need some young blood in this.  It's there, Bellowes, I
am persuaded, but we shall have to figure carefully on
getting it out.'"
</p>

<p>
"Humph," said Hugh.  "That's not much to go on.
Do you know what he did with the missing half of the
Instructions he said he found?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  He never showed it to me, and so far as I
know, he did not have it in his possession when he was
here."
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't have carried it, or even a copy of it, if he
had supposed others had an interest in it," I interposed.
</p>

<p>
"True," assented Hugh.  "Well, let's have a look at
the Charter Chest."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bellowes went to a safe in the corner, and took from
an inner compartment a bunch of heavy keys, some of
them comparatively modern, others clumsy and ancient.
With these he opened lock after lock along front and sides
of the old chest.  Hugh and I carefully raised the lid.
A musty odor floated up to us, such an odor as you find
in old books.  The chest, itself, was packed with smaller
boxes, some of wood and some of iron and steel.
</p>

<p>
The aged solicitor indicated a massive steel box in one
corner.
</p>

<p>
"That contains the Instructions and related documents
your lordship," he said, and lifting it to the table top
fitted a small key to the lock.
</p>

<p>
There was a click, and the cover flew back.  Inside was
a wooden lid, which Hugh pried up with his thumb-nail,
and below that a layer of oiled silk, and below that again
more layers of cloth, silk and linen.  Finally, we came to
several framed parchments, with glasses in front and
back.
</p>

<p>
"Your uncle did that," explained Mr. Bellowes.  "He
was afraid they would be ruined by handling and exposure."
</p>

<p>
The first frame contained a sheet of parchment, I should
say, twelve inches by ten, covered with minute Black
Letter script in a rather corrupt form of mediæval Latin.
</p>

<p>
"That is Hugh's Instructions," said the solicitor.  "I'd
advise you not to strain your eyes trying to make out the
original.  We had a very careful translation prepared,
and checked over by scholars at Oxford."
</p>

<p>
He drew out a typewritten sheet of foolscap, and Nikka
and I read it over Hugh's shoulder:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-029"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-029.jpg" alt="typewritten foolscap" />
</p>

<p>
"INSTRUCTIONS of Hugh, Lord of Chesby.  I, Hugh,
write this for my son, and it may be, those who come after him.
</p>

<p>
"In the reign of the Emperor Andronicus Comnenus my
father visited Constantinople, and the Emperor made much of
him.  At the Emperor's request my father aided in the
disposition of a certain treasure which Andronicus had amassed by
confiscating and fining the estates of rebel nobles.  None save
these two knew the location of the treasure.
</p>

<p>
"It chanced that my father passed oversea to the Holy Land
to make good his vows to Our Lady the Virgin, and the Emperor
Andronicus was slain by his enemies.  The Emperor Isaac, who
succeeded Andronicus, sent urgent messages to my father,
bidding him visit Constantinople that the new Emperor might do
him honor.  And in time my father journeyed again to
Constantinople, and the Emperor would have had him yield the
secret of the treasure.  But my father would not, because
Andronicus had obtained from him a solemn oath never to give
up the treasure to any save one who would spend it for the
bettering of the Empire, and the new Emperor craved it for
his courtiers and courtesans.  Then the Emperor threw my
father into prison, and so kept him until Messer Baldwin of
Flanders and Messer Dandolo of Venice and the barons of the
Crusade went against the Emperor and smote him down.
</p>

<p>
"Ill-fortune continued to beset the Empire, and so my father
kept the secret.  In God's appointed time he died and passed
on the secret to me.  Now, I, too, see Death riding toward me,
nor do I fear it, for those I love are in the Shadow Worlds of
Hell or Purgatory.
</p>

<p>
"Harken, then, my son, and those of your seed who come after
us.  The Lords of Constantinople are rotten.  Their Empire
dwindles away.  The treasure is not for such as they.
Therefore I say it shall go to augment the fortunes of our house
and recompense my father's sufferings.
</p>

<p>
"Take it, he who can.  But beware the Greeks, for some know
of the treasure and the secret will not die.
</p>

<p>
"In Manus Tuas, Domine."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Hugh let fall the typed script, and we all stared reverently
at the original parchment under its sheltering glass.
There was something inexpressibly poignant about these
words carried across the ages from a Norman-English
baron to his modern descendant.
</p>

<p>
"Is there anything else?" asked Hugh.  "It's odd, he
speaks so impressively of going after the treasure, and yet
he offers no hint of how to find it.  Was the secret always
unknown?  But no, of course not!  There was that chap
in Henry the Fifth's time, and the Elizabethan Hugh.
They knew where it was."
</p>

<p>
"There is another document here which sheds light upon
that phase of the mystery," volunteered Mr. Bellowes, and
he sorted an envelope from the mass of documents in the
steel box.
</p>

<p>
From the envelope he drew a heavy sheet of yellowed
linen paper inscribed in an angular feminine hand in very
faded black ink.
</p>

<p>
"This was written by the widow of the Elizabethan
Hugh," the old solicitor continued.  "Her husband, as
you may remember, my lord, never returned from one of
his voyages.  His lady seems to have been a strong-minded
person, after the fashion of her royal mistress, indeed.
She was in charge of the estate for some years in the
minority of her son, and she evidently used her authority."
</p>

<p>
He spread the paper before us.  It was dated "Castle
Chesby, ye 5th Septr., 1592," and we read the vigorous
strokes with ease:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Forasmuch as yt hath pleased God to sette mee in authoritie
in this my deere late Husband's place, I have seene fitte to
Take that Roote of Evill which hath beene ye bane of Oure
race Fromme oute ye Chartar Cheste and putte yt where yt may
Wreak noe more Of harmme and Sorrowe.  I will not have my
Sonne awasting of Hys substaunce and hys Life as didde Hys
deere Fathour.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"JANE CHESBY.
</p>

<p>
"Postscriptum.  Yette will I leave a trase for Thatte yt might
seeme Unfaithfull to ye Dead didde I lose thatte whych ys a
part of ye House's wealthe."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"What do you make out of that?" I asked in bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
Hugh and Mr. Bellowes laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I remember hearing of this, but I never saw it before,"
said Hugh.  "Jane Chesby was a character, by all accounts."
</p>

<p>
"The tradition," said the solicitor, "is that the 'Roote
of Evill' was the part of the Instructions containing the
directions to the location of the treasure.  At any rate,
there is no record of its having been seen since the date
of Lady Jane's minute."
</p>

<p>
"But the 'trase' she speaks of?" I queried.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody has ever found it&mdash;unless Lord James did so."
</p>

<p>
"What is that on the back of the paper?" Nikka asked.
</p>

<p>
"The lady seems also to have been a poetess," said
Mr. Bellowes with a smile.  "They are some lines she scrawled,
apparently without any reference to the matter on the
other side."
</p>

<p>
Nikka turned the paper over.  The lines were scrawled,
as the lawyer had said, diagonally across the sheet, as if
in a moment of abstraction:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-033"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-033.jpg" alt="ancient poem" />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putte downe ye Anciount riddel<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vex hymme who doth Endeavour,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor treate Hys efortte tendour.<br />
</p>

<p>
"A farrago of antique spelling and nonsense,"
commented Hugh.  "That gets us no farther."
</p>

<p>
"Still, I suggest we take a copy of it with us," said
Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"It won't do any harm," agreed Mr. Bellowes, and he
called a stenographer and directed him to make copies of
the two writings.
</p>

<p>
"This Lady Jane was a ferocious Protestant," pursued
Hugh reflectively.  "It was she who blocked up the old
family crypt, saying it was not fit to bury Protestant
Chesbys with the Papist lords in a place that had known
the rites of the Scarlet Woman and all that sort of stuff."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Bellowes, turning from the stenographer,
"and if you recall, my lord, she blocked up the
crypt so successfully that its exact location has been a
mystery ever since."  And to us he explained: "It lies
somewhere under the extensive ruins of Crowden Priory,
an old monastic establishment which was closely linked with
Chesby in the Middle Ages."
</p>

<p>
Hugh rose reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid we have learned nothing here," he said.
"Have we exhausted the Charter Chest?"
</p>

<p>
"Unless you wish to read the brief records of the
Elizabethan Hugh and his ancestor of Henry the Fifth's time,"
replied the lawyer.  "Neither furnishes any concrete
information.  The one records the suspicion and hampering
of the Greeks; the other was never allowed about except
under escort of Janissaries."
</p>

<p>
"Then we have done all we can," said Hugh.  "We'll
take the night train for Chesby."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bellowes suspended his work of returning the
several documents to their places in the steel box.
</p>

<p>
"I do hope you will take thought to whatever you do,
your lordship," he urged.  "As you see, the trail so far
is blind, and whatever validity we may attach to your
uncle's assertion that he had discovered the clue, it must
be manifest that you are helpless until you have learned
as much as he did."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right," returned Hugh, somewhat to
the old gentleman's surprise.  "But we intend to find out
what my uncle discovered.  If he did not overrate his
achievement, then you may be sure that we shall do
everything in our power to obtain the treasure."
</p>

<p>
"You must admit that common sense can dictate no other
course.  You say I am ruined as it is.  Well, then, I can
well afford to risk whatever is left on the chance of
extricating the estate."
</p>

<p>
The lawyer wagged his gray head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"It's a very sad situation for me, Mister Hugh&mdash;beg
pardon, your lordship," he sighed.  "One way, as you say,
it's ruin, to put the facts bluntly.  The other way, there'll
be terrible danger.  Well, sir, I wish you and your friends
the best of luck, and whatever poor service I can afford
you you may rely upon."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
THE GUNROOM AT CASTLE CHESBY
</h3>

<p>
The inimitable Watkins met us at Chesby station
with a motor in which we were whirled off
through mirky woods and a half-seen park to a
low, rambling building of varying architecture set on the
summit of a saddle-back hill.  Lights showed in one wing,
but the center and other wing were dark.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry, your ludship," apologized Watkins,
as he assisted us from the car in front of a Tudor
archway.  "It's been some years since the 'ouse has been
opened.  Your uncle, 'e was used to living 'ere in the
Old Wing, and we're under-staffed, if I may say so,
your ludship, for&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It suits me, Watty," returned Hugh.  "My friends
are not company, and of course, we shall not entertain.
It would be foolish to open up the entire place."
</p>

<p>
He stood on the doorstep, glancing around him at the
thick, ivy-draped walls and the machicolated parapets
which lined the roofs.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome to Chesby, you chaps," he hailed us.  "It
gives me a thrill to come here.  I haven't seen it since
before the war, except for one brief visit two years ago,
and I haven't really lived here since I was a lad."
</p>

<p>
A butler no less dignified than Watkins held the door
open for us, and a palsied footman strove with the valet
for custody of our scanty baggage.  Watkins motioned
both aside when we entered the high-pitched hall.
</p>

<p>
"This way, if you please, your ludship and gentlemen,"
he said.  "I 'ave 'ad supper served in the Gunroom.  'Is
late ludship used it as a snuggery, as 'e called it, Mister
Hugh&mdash;beg pardon, sir, your ludship&mdash;and far more
cheery it is, sir, with a bright fire and all, than the
other rooms."
</p>

<p>
"That's fine," approved Hugh, and he led us after
Watkins through a short passage to the right and into a
big room, with mullioned windows, deeply-embrasured,
and carved oaken rafters and stone walls showing above
the rich paneling that rose a tall man's height from the
floor.  At one side was a vast fireplace, with chimney-piece,
ingle-nooks and over-mantle elaborately carved.  A
log-fire blazed on the dogs, and before it, warmly illuminated,
a table was set with snowy linen and silver emblazoned
with the Chesby crest, a mailed arm clutching a
dagger and beneath it an open eye, with the motto "I
search."
</p>

<p>
Hugh rubbed his hands with satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"This is home," he said.
</p>

<p>
But a shadow instantly chased the smile from his lips.
</p>

<p>
"And if Bellowes is correct, it will continue to be my
home only if we succeed in finding something lost more
than seven hundred years ago," he added.
</p>

<p>
"If it is to be found we shall find it," answered Nikka.
"What a beautiful room!"
</p>

<p>
"I was going to say the same thing," I said.  "As an
architect, I have tried to achieve this effect for rich
Americans, but I must admit I can't do with mere money what
time and many men's imaginations have accomplished
here."
</p>

<p>
"And women's imaginations, too," replied Hugh.
"This is the oldest part of the castle, but it has felt
the influence of that redoubtable Lady Jane you heard
about this afternoon.  I believe this wing is supposed to
be the remains of the Angevin keep and Great Hall of the
first Hugh's castle, which were partially destroyed in the
Wars of the Roses, and again by fire in Bloody Mary's
time.  Lady Jane rebuilt this wing and joined it with
what was then the modern, and early Tudor, central
mass."
</p>

<p>
Curious, I stepped over to the fireplace and examined
the splendid carvings in deep relief that adorned stone
and woodwork.  High up near the roof on the over-mantel
I discerned the family crest, together with numerous
heraldic shields in colors faded and dimmed.  But the
most curious feature of the ornamentation was a lower
panel supported by a group of bibulous monks in comically
disordered attitudes.  On the panel appeared to be lettering.
</p>

<p>
"Watkins," I called, "bring me a candle, please."
</p>

<p>
He lifted a weighty candelabra from the table and
carried it toward me, Hugh and Nikka trailing him like
small boys eager to view anything new.  As he held it
aloft, arm-high, the soft light shone on four lines of Gothic
lettering which had once been gilded.  They showed
clearly in the age-old oak of the paneling:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-038"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-038.jpg" alt="Gothic lettering" />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Whenne thatte ye Pappist Churchmanne<br />

  He tookened up ye Wysshinge Stone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And trodde ye Prior's Vent.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I had forgotten that," exclaimed Hugh.  "It's some
more of Lady Jane's poetry.'
</p>

<p>
"She seems to have been rather hipped that way," I
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Now you speak of it, I can't recall any other
specimens of her wit in rhyme," answered Hugh, puzzled.
"Can you, Watty?"
</p>

<p>
"No, your ludship.  'Is ludship, your late uncle, made a
careful examination of Lady Jane's papers, but 'e found
no other verses."
</p>

<p>
"But what was her idea here?" I persisted, for the
whimsicalness of the thing interested me.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as I told you, she was virulently anti-Catholic,"
said Hugh carelessly.  "It was she, you know, who sealed
up the old family crypt and built a new one in the Priory,
as the parish church is called.  She probably believed
that the former monks of the Priory had been more
interested in their wine-cellar than in masses."
</p>

<p>
"But the 'Prior's Vent'?  What on earth is that?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, unless it was the way to the wine-cellar.
Don't you see the point?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't.  And this 'Wysshinge Stone,' too?  What
could that be?"
</p>

<p>
"It must have been something connected with entering
the wine-cellar.  Oh, it's all perfectly simple, Jack.
Crowden Priory was one of those establishments guilty
of abuses which furnished Henry the Eighth with his
excuse for looting the monastic orders.  The facts were
still a matter of memory in Lady Jane's time, and she
took advantage of them to mock the Catholics.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
I did not answer him for I had become engrossed in the
decorations of the stone mantel, itself, a magnificent piece
of freestone, sculptured in a frieze of Turks' heads,
sphinxes and veiled women, ranged alternately.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she&mdash;or her masons, I should say&mdash;did a fine
job," I said at last, tearing myself reluctantly from the
beautiful courses of stone and the even flags of the hearth.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have plenty of time to indulge your architect's
eye hereabouts," declared Hugh from the table.  "Come
and eat or Nikka will leave you nothing.  Watty, what
is the news?"
</p>

<p>
The valet deposited a chafing dish and stand by my
place.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Penfellow, the Vicar, your ludship, instructed me
to tell you the service for 'is late ludship would be
tomorrow morning, as you requested.  'E had made all
arrangements consequent upon receiving your ludship's
cablegram.  Oh, yes, sir, and Mr. Hilyer was over from
Little Depping this afternoon in a motor&mdash;with some
ladies, sir&mdash;and asked after you.  'E said 'e would be at
the funeral, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hugh frowned.
</p>

<p>
"I will not have anything to do with that bounder," he
grunted.
</p>

<p>
"'E 'as quite a lively time, so the servants tell me, your
ludship," volunteered Watkins.  "A regular 'ouse-party
'e's entertaining now, with foreign gentry and all."
</p>

<p>
"They would be foreign," retorted Hugh.  "He can't
get a decent Englishman inside his house, and if he thinks
I shall fall for him just because I've spent two years in
America&mdash;" he broke into a sudden grin&mdash;"It's rather
funny, Jack.  I expect he believes I've been
metamorphosed into a bloomin' democrat.  The bounder!"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with the man?" inquired Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Everything!  The Hilyers own the next place to
us&mdash;Little Depping, it's called.  They were always decent
enough people, but this chap, Montey Hilyer, is a wrong
'un.  He got into trouble before the War with the Stewards
of the Jockey Club and was barred from the course.  Then
he picked up a reputation as a card-sharp and society
gambler.  For a while he used to hang around Continental
resorts and fleece the innocent.
</p>

<p>
"When the War came he enlisted, made a splendid
record and earned a commission.  The next thing that
happened was a scandal in his mess over heavy play, and
he was compelled to resign.  He's a bad egg, through and
through.  Odd, though, how he keeps up Little Depping.
I believe he's been on short rations more than once, but
he always has managed to preserve the estate&mdash;and like
me, he's the last of the line."
</p>

<p>
Watkins removed the savory, and received a platter
of sandwiches from the butler, who he permitted to come
no farther than the door.
</p>

<p>
"And your ludship may remember Mr. Hilyer married
some years ago&mdash;before 'e got into trouble, sir," he
observed as he placed the platter before us.  "She was, if
I may say so, your ludship, not one of us."
</p>

<p>
Watkins contrived to express deep disapprobation,
without wrinkling or contorting his countenance, a trick at
which I always marveled.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," assented Hugh.  "She was an actress or
something like that.  Well, it's in the beggar's favor that
he married her.  But they can't come footling around here.
I'd have the whole County up in arms against me."
</p>

<p>
We chatted on for a while, and then Watkins guided us
to the upper story where three adjoining bedrooms had
been made ready.
</p>

<p>
"The bathroom is across the 'all, sir," he informed me,
stopping at my door on his way from Hugh's room.  "My
room is beside it.  You 'ave only to ring, sir, if you wish
anything.  Good night, sir."
</p>

<p>
As he left, I reflected with a grin that I had not been
so coddled since my schooldays as in the brief period
following his adoption of Hugh and myself.  For that
was what it amounted to.  For all his deference and
servility, neither Hugh nor I would have dared to withstand
any wish which Watkins gave serious expression to, and
furthermore, he made us feel constantly that we were
obligated to maintain a certain standard of conduct, which
he, Watkins, might find satisfaction in.
</p>

<p>
I was up early the next morning, and a brief scouting
tour revealed Nikka's room empty, while Hugh snoozed
blissfully on.  So I shaved and bathed, and descended the
broad, shallow staircase into the entrance hall below.  This
wing, I noted, seemed to be shut off entirely from the
remainder of the house.  At any rate, there were no open
corridors.
</p>

<p>
Watkins was arranging flowers in a luster bowl on a
table under an oriel window, and I mentioned this fact to
him as I stood on the lowest step, drinking in the wonderful
satisfaction of a perfectly designed and furnished
entrance, something that it takes the average architect ten
years to learn how to do.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, sir," he answered.  "There are corridors,
but they are shut off, in order to save heat, sir, and
prevent draughts.  Since the death of the old lord,
sir&mdash;Mister Hugh's grandfather&mdash;we 'ave 'ad such a small
family that no occasion was found for all the rooms.  And
the old wing, sir, is a large 'ouse by itself."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that makes so much less for us to defend," I
said.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"In case our friends of Toutou's gang should try to
attack us," I explained.
</p>

<p>
But Watkins was as positive as Mr. Bellowes that such
things could not transpire in England.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, sure I am you need not concern yourself for
that," he said seriously.  "They would never dare.  The
constabulary, sir&mdash;and all that."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," I said.  "What is that music?"
</p>

<p>
He inclined his ear towards the door of a room that
opened from the opposite side of the hall to the Gunroom.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir.  That's Mister Nikka.  'E's in the music room
aplaying to 'imself, sir."
</p>

<p>
I crossed to the half-open door and peered inside.
Nikka was sitting at a pianoforte in a flood of sunshine,
and the music poured from his lips and fingers, like the
sunshine, passionately intense, warm and vital.  It stirred
me as I listened, searching out primitive impulses,
painting sound-pictures of outlandish scenes, spreading exotic
odors over that conventional room.  It was rebellious,
uncivilized, untamed&mdash;and I liked it.
</p>

<p>
He crooned to himself, rather than sang, but the words
and the melody, savage, melancholy, joyously-somber, beat
their way into my brain:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sad is the ache in my heart;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cities crowd me in.<br />
  I may not breath for their stench,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ears are deaf from their din.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let me go forth from their ways,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out where the road runs free,<br />
  Twisting over the Balkan hills<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the restless sea.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The dust shall caress my feet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shall warm my limbs,<br />
  The trees shall tell me their thoughts<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk as the twilight dims.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And I shall inhale the smoke<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fires beside the road;<br />
  I shall hear the camels grunt<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the drivers shift their loads.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And best of all, I shall hear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild, mad Tzigane songs,<br />
  Cruel and gay and lustful,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like fiddles and clanging gongs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And in the glare of the campfires<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall see the Tziganes dance&mdash;<br />
  Women with lithe, round bodies,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men straight as a heiduck's lance.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And perhaps a wild brown maiden<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will seek me amongst the throng,<br />
  And dance with me down the twisting road<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a wild, mad Tzigane song.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He ended with a crashing of keys, and looked up to meet
my fascinated gaze.
</p>

<p>
"You liked it?" he asked shyly.  "I can see you did.
It is a little song I have made out of the heart-beats of my
people.  We Gypsies can make music, if nothing else.  And
all Gypsy music should be played on strings.  Only the
fiddle can reach the heights and depths of human emotion.
But I have put my fiddle away from me until we have
finished this job."
</p>

<p>
He walked over and slipped his arm through mine.
</p>

<p>
"Let us see what Watty has for breakfast," he went
on, "and send him to awaken that lazy-bones, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"But see here, Nikka," I broke in.  "Are you really
a Gypsy?  In the usual sense of the word?"
</p>

<p>
He considered as he explored a fruit-dish.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean by 'the usual sense of the
word,'" he answered finally.  "I am a Gypsy by birth
and blood.  I passed my boyhood with the caravans.  I
learned to play the fiddle with the Gypsy maestros of
Hungary."
</p>

<p>
"It's funny," I admitted, "but I never quite envisaged
you as a Gypsy until I heard you sing that song."
</p>

<p>
Nikka smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I can understand that.  I made up that song because I
was feeling the lure of the blood.  The Gypsy in me has
been crying out for assertion.  I think that is one reason
why I was so glad to have Hugh call on me.  I smelled
in his need a chance to sample the old, wild life again."
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe the Gypsies play a part in this treasure
business?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I feel it in my bones.  It is a Gypsy tradition, remember.
Probably we shall find the interest of some Tzigane
tribe crossing ours."
</p>

<p>
"And then?"
</p>

<p>
"My tribe fight for Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"Your tribe?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely, I have a tribe.  They fight for my hand and
for my friends."
</p>

<p>
I regarded him with increased respect.
</p>

<p>
"That has a delightfully mediæval sound.  It strikes
me you are going to be the most valuable member of this
expedition."
</p>

<p>
"All for one, and one for all," laughed Nikka.
</p>

<p>
He waved a greeting to Hugh, who came in at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"We are talking about Gypsies and fighting," he explained.
</p>

<p>
"And it seems that Nikka is a potentate who has a tribe
to carry out his wishes," I amended.
</p>

<p>
"I wish we had his tribe here to help us pull down
this old stone-box," answered Hugh gloomily.  "How
else are we going to uncover any hiding-places?  And I
feel like fighting when I remember that we are going to
Uncle James's funeral this morning.  Well, the best way
to fight, I suppose, is to search.  That's the family motto.
Jack, you'll have a first rate opportunity to investigate
early structural methods in English architecture.  I
expect you'll be the only one to get anything out of the
affair."
</p>

<p>
Which last was a very poor piece of prophecy.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
A BLIND ALLEY
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Penfellow, the Vicar, received us at the
west door of the parish church, a gigantic
edifice which was all that was left of the once
noble foundation of the Priory of St. Cuthbert of Crowden.
With verger and curate, both striving mightily to equal his
solemn countenance, he escorted Hugh&mdash;and incidentally,
Nikka and me&mdash;up the center aisle to a high-walled pew
directly under the choir.  Immediately behind us, Watkins
was marshaling the slender array of servants from Castle
Chesby, all of whom had come to pay the lost honors to
their dead master.
</p>

<p>
The church was so large that the considerable congregation
were swallowed up in its echoing nave.  The transepts
contained nothing save monuments and tombs.
The tempered light that stole through stained-glass
windows left most of the space in shadow, but I descried
beyond the breadth of the crossing a second box-like pew
identical with ours, and in it a company whose gay
raiment and gabbling ways were out of place in contrast
with the stolid piety of the village folk and neighboring
gentry.
</p>

<p>
"There's Hilyer," muttered Hugh in my ear, as the
verger pompously presented his mace and the Vicar
withdrew toward the altar.
</p>

<p>
But we had no time to spare for observing the county's
black sheep.  Mr. Penfellow's quavering, nasal voice
began to intone the stately rite of the Established Church
for the dead.  The shrill voices of the choir-boys responded.
</p>

<p>
Our eyes became fastened upon the oblong casket resting
on its low catafalque under the choir railing, which
contained the body of James Chesby, that quaint, whimsical,
Twentieth Century knight errant, who had upheld the
traditions of his race by tilting over the world in pursuit
of a prize which all sober men proclaimed to be impossible
of attainment.
</p>

<p>
And he had as good as found it!  Laughed at, derided,
mocked and ridiculed, he had persisted doggedly in what
he had regarded as his life-work.  He had succeeded where
all others had failed or feared to venture.  And at the
last, probably when he envisaged complete success in his
grasp, he had accepted death rather than yield the prize
to any but his heir.  He must have had good stuff in
him, that slight, wan-faced slip of a man, whom I had
only seen as he lay on his death-bed in the hospital, his
eyes shining to the end with indomitable spirit.
</p>

<p>
As I thought of him, cut and hacked by that brute Toutou,
I found my fingers clenching on the book-rack in front
of me; and glancing down, I saw Hugh's knuckles, too,
were white.  We exchanged a grim glance.  For the first
time we understood fully that we were playing a man's
game, a game in which there was no limit.  And we
experienced the thirst for action which comes from a
desire to slake unsatisfied vengeance.  This task we had set
ourselves to was more than a hunt for treasure.  It was
likewise a pursuit of James Chesby's murderers.
</p>

<p>
Nikka must have read somewhat of our thoughts in our
faces, for he reached behind me and slid a hand over
Hugh's straining knuckles; and I saw that his lips were
shut tight and his eyes blazing like coals under their eagle
brows.  And then my eyes chanced to stray toward the
opposite side of the crossing, and in the shadows that
hovered over the Hilyer pew I glimpsed a pair of eyes
that gleamed with the evil green light of a beast of prey.
For an instant only they showed.  Then the shadows
moved, and they disappeared.  Startled, I looked again, and
saw nothing.  It must have been fancy, I told myself,
a trick of the sunbeams filtered through the particolored
glass of the windows.  And I turned my ear to the
cadenced voice of the Vicar:
</p>

<p>
"Man, that is born of a woman, hath but a short time
to live, and is full of misery.  He cometh up, and is
cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and
never continueth in one stay."
</p>

<p>
The formal service was soon ended, and after the
congregation had filed out, a little knot of men from Chesby
farms poised the casket on their shoulders and paced
slowly after Mr. Penfellow and the verger down the broad,
winding stairs to the pillared crypt.  At the east end,
beneath the altar, the verger unlocked a massy oaken door
and behind that an iron grate.  There was a minute's
delay while he lit tall candles, and then the little procession
marched on into the last resting-place of the Chesbys.
</p>

<p>
It was an octagonal chamber, Tudor in style and extraordinarily
spacious, the groined roof springing lightly from
slender pillars.  At the far end was a simple altar, and
all around the other segments of the octagon were ledges
in two tiers.  At intervals over the floor space were tombs
and sarcophagi.  The flickering candles brought out an
occasional inscription.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Hugh James Cuthbert................twenty-eighth Baron Chesby."
</p>

<p>
"Claudia Anne, Lady Chesby, aetat 34, beloved..........
James, twenty-first................"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On several coffins reposing on the side ledges there were
the moldering remnants of old flags.  On one lay an
officer's cocked hat and sword, tarnished and covered with
dust.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Penfellow was bowing to Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"The&mdash;ah&mdash;space next your grandfather, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh nodded dumbly, and the men carrying the casket
shifted it gently into the niche adjoining the twenty-eighth
baron's.  Once they had set it in place, we were at some
difficulty to distinguish it from those above and on either
side of it.  They were all exactly alike.  And how
different, probably, had been the men and women they
held!
</p>

<p>
Hugh stumbled forward, and knelt beneath his uncle's
casket.  Nikka, beside me, breathed hastily in my ear:
</p>

<p>
"I can't stand this, Jack.  How can people be buried
in stone vaults?  I'm choking."
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for a reply, he slipped away between
the pillars, and I was left alone with Mr. Penfellow.  The
verger was just shepherding the pall-bearers through the
gate.
</p>

<p>
"A very sad chapter in the glorious history of this
ancient family, Mr. Nash," murmured the vicar with moist
eyes.  "But surely no man could hope for a grander
Valhalla."
</p>

<p>
He gestured toward the encircling tombs.
</p>

<p>
"All of the line since Elizabethan times.  That is, all
the lords and their ladies.  Cadets and collaterals are
buried elsewhere in the church.  Have you heard the story
of Lady Jane Chesby, the builder of this chamber?  Ah!
Very interesting, is it not?  Her own husband was lost at
sea, you know.  But here is an empty tomb she reared to
him."
</p>

<p>
He led me to the handsomest sarcophagus in the center
of the chamber.  On the marble lid was carved life-size
the effigy of a man in half-armor, sea-boots and morion.
In his hands, clasped upon his breast, he grasped a sextant.
</p>

<p>
The lettering of the inscription on the side I hastily
deciphered as:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-049"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-049.jpg" alt="inscription" />
</p>

<p>
"James Matthew Kymmer, Baron Chesby<br />
Hereditarie Rangare of Crowdene Wood,<br />
Admirall of ye Queene's Gracious Majestie,<br />
Scourge of ye Spaniards and all Papists and<br />
Infidells, Lost at Sea anno apud. 1590<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And underneath this;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-050"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-050.jpg" alt="inscription" />
</p>

<p>
"Deere Lord, I, that was yr Bedfellowe,<br />
do reare thys thatte yf yt please Godde so to do<br />
and Hee bringe You to my Side there shal not<br />
Lacke a Space."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The famous Lady Jane rests under the adjoining
sarcophagus with the plain lid," continued the Vicar.  "I
wish we might find the old crypt.  It is somewhere under
the Priory grounds but she concealed it very effectually.
The tradition is that the old lords were buried in their
mail.  They were all noted as warriors.  Ah, Lord
Chesby," as Hugh rose and walked over to us.  "This
has been very sad, very sad, indeed.  And yet, as I was
saying to Mr. Nash, it is something for a man after he
dies to be brought back to wait the Last Trump in such
glorious company."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I have been thinking of the criminals
who murdered my uncle," said Hugh curtly.  "You have
been very kind, sir.  I should like to thank you and
everybody else for what they have done.  Where's Nikka,
Jack?  Gone up?  Do you mind if we leave you to shut
the vault, Mr. Penfellow?  Thank you again."
</p>

<p>
He hooked his arm in mine, and together we passed out
of that sepulchral chamber, with its great company of
illustrious dead.  Upstairs in the church porch Nikka was
awaiting us, breathing in deep gusts of the air that blew
in tinctured with the perfume of Crowden Forest that
stretched all around the village.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Hugh," he exclaimed, taking Hugh's other
arm, "I couldn't wait.  There's something in me that
rebels against your churches.  I feel the same way about
mosques and synagogues, for that matter.  And as for
being buried down in a close, stone-lined hole in the ground,
herded in with other dead!"  He shivered violently.
"I hope not!  If there is a God&mdash;and there must be
some kind of one to make the trees and hills and the grass
and to put music in one's heart&mdash;why, I pray to Him
that I shall lie on a hillside, with only the trees around
me and the sun beating down."
</p>

<p>
Hugh smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Each to his own, Nikka.  You are a Gypsy, a son of
the open road.  I am an Englishman, son to these stone
walls, that old house we came from.  I cannot get away
from it.  I am bound up with them.  So long as they
and I last we shall be indivisible."
</p>

<p>
"And what am I?" I demanded lightly.
</p>

<p>
"You?  You are an American.  The world is your
oyster.  You can be satisfied in any way, in Nikka's way
or in mine."
</p>

<p>
It was a scant ten minutes' walk through the park to
Castle Chesby.  As we entered the drive, Watkins, who
had driven back with the servants, came around the house
from the stables and started to run toward us.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody broke in whilst we were at church, your
ludship," he panted when he was within earshot.
</p>

<p>
We were all startled.
</p>

<p>
"Anything missing?" questioned Hugh sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I can't say as yet, your ludship.  They seem to 'ave
been only in the unoccupied parts.  I fancy, sir, they
'adn't the time to go through the West Wing."
</p>

<p>
We hastened into the house after him.  A rear door in
the center of the castle&mdash;it was really more of a manor
than a castle in style&mdash;had been forced.  Desks, wardrobes,
chests of drawers, closets, armories, every corner or piece of
furniture that might conceal anything had been thoroughly
ransacked.  Drawers and their contents were still piled
helter-skelter on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose they could have found anything?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
Watkins shook his head positively.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure they could not, Mr. Nash, sir.  I think I
know most of the stuff that they have gone through.  Oh,
in a very general way, your ludship, to be sure.  But I am
sure 'is late ludship was not in the 'abit of keeping
anything he was precious of in the East Wing or the Main
'Ouse, sir."
</p>

<p>
We left Watkins to supervise the servants in reëstablishing
order in the upset rooms, and returned to the West
Wing.  In the Gunroom, Hugh lit a cigarette and straddled
his legs in front of the fire.  Nikka and I dropped
into the lounge that faced the hearth.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Hugh, and his lips had resumed the
grim line I had noticed in church.
</p>

<p>
"Who are they?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Good idea," approved Hugh, and he rang the bell by
the door.
</p>

<p>
Watkins arrived with the celerity of a djin.
</p>

<p>
"Watty, I wish you'd make inquiries along the roads,
and find out if any strangers have been seen around the
place this morning.  Oh, yes, and tell the servants not to
talk.  You understand?  Not to talk.  The man or woman
who talks is to be dismissed."
</p>

<p>
"That was another good idea," said Nikka.  "Our best
bet is to keep our mouths shut.  They, whoever, they are,
have us guessing.  Maybe we can make them guess a little.
And that reminds me, do you realize that they have saved
us quite a bit of searching?"
</p>

<p>
"You mean in turning two-thirds of the house upside
down?" answered Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Just that.  And I'd suggest that we waste no time
in going thoroughly over this wing, ourselves."
</p>

<p>
We set to work with gusto.  On my suggestion&mdash;they
nominated me captain in this enterprise because of my
supposed architectural knowledge&mdash;we commenced with
the Gunroom.  We examined it from end to end, tapped
the paneling for secret recesses, examined the furniture.
No result.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon, we began on the upper floor and went
over the entire wing in detail.  We measured the
different rooms.  I even took outer measurements.  We
studied chimneys.  We sounded floors.  We took to pieces
every article of furniture which might have concealed a
secret drawer&mdash;and we found several hidden receptacles,
by the way, but they contained nothing beyond ordinary
family letters and trash.  Immersed in the hunt and
baffled by lack of success, we caused Watkins to put off
dinner, and worked on until after nine o'clock.  Still no
success.
</p>

<p>
We went to bed that night, tired out and disgusted.
But in the morning we arose with sharpened interest and
determined to canvas the possibilities in the parts of the
house the invaders had searched.  Again we took careful
measurements, inside and out.  Again we sounded paneling,
investigated recesses and chimney spaces.  We
hunted for two days.  Then we went back, and reëxamined
the West Wing a second time.  We ended up in stark
disappointment in the Gunroom.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it all!" ripped Hugh.  "The trouble is that
my family were not Catholics in the times when priests
were proscribed, and every self-respecting Catholic family
had its Priest's Hole."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not worried just because your family can't boast
an accessible hiding-place," I retorted.  "What bothers
me is that their hiding-place, if they have one, is so
cunningly hidden that we can't find it."
</p>

<p>
"'If they have one,'" repeated Hugh.  "You may
well say that!  I am beginning to believe we may be on
a wild goose chase, after all.'
</p>

<p>
"If we were the only ones after it, I might think so," I
replied.
</p>

<p>
Nikka, who had relapsed into one of his frequent spells
of silent contemplation, jumped suddenly from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"If it is here, it is in this room," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Is that a Gypsy prophecy?" jeered Hugh.
</p>

<p>
There was a racket of motors outside in the drive, and
Watkins appeared in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, your ludship.  But I thought you would wish
to know Mr. Hilyer and 'is party 'ave just driven up.'
</p>

<p>
"The devil they have!" exclaimed Hugh.  "I suppose
we'll have to see 'em."
</p>

<p>
But Watkins lingered in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
Watkins cleared his throat.
</p>

<p>
"You may remember you instructed me to inquire if
strangers 'ad been seen on the roads 'ereabouts the
morning of the funeral, your ludship."
</p>

<p>
Hugh nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Dobson at the Lodge said nobody passed on the
village road, your ludship.  And I made other inquiries,
but without success until I met 'Iggins, the carpenter,
sir, this morning.  'E said one of Mr. Hilyer's motors
passed on the London road close on noon, but that was
all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that doesn't help any," said Hugh.  "Whoever
did it must have taken to the woods and cut across to the
Channel road."
</p>

<p>
"They need only 'ave dropped over the park wall to
reach the London Road, your ludship," suggested Watkins.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see your point," agreed Hugh.  "Then Hilyer's
people might have seen them.  I'll find an opportunity to
speak to him about it.'
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, your ludship."
</p>

<p>
And Watkins withdrew.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
THE HILYER PARTY
</h3>

<p>
"Mr. and Mrs. Hilyer, your ludship!"
</p>

<p>
And never in my life have I seen anything
more splendid than the emotionless disapproval
with which Watkins was able to invest his
countenance as he announced our callers.
</p>

<p>
Hilyer was a lean, rangy chap, with a hatchet face and
close-set eyes.  His mustache was waxed in the Continental
fashion, and he had slim, powerful hands, the hands
of a born horseman and gambler.  He looked what he was:
good blood gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
His wife was a handsome, statuesque woman, awfully
well turned out.  She was absolutely in the mode, as
perfect as a show-girl in a Gayety production.  And she had
cold eyes that saw everything, and never lost their icy
glitter even when her manner was warmest.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Hugh!" exclaimed Hilyer.  "Frightfully glad
to see you home again, but rotten sorry for the occasion.
You don't know Mrs. Hilyer, I believe."
</p>

<p>
Hugh bowed to her with cold precision.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Hilyer&mdash;" just a shade of emphasis on the
family name&mdash;"it was kind of you to come.  We are
keeping bachelors' hall, Mrs. Hilyer, and I am afraid our
entertaining resources are limited."
</p>

<p>
"Don't let that bother you," protested Mrs. Hilyer
affably, "and if you and your friends want any lively
diversion on the quiet, remember we keep liberty hall
over at Little Depping.  We wanted our&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But I lost the thread of her conversation as I found
myself staring into those same evil green eyes that I had
seen peering out of the shadows of the Hilyer pew the
morning of the funeral.  The man they belonged to had
entered the room immediately after the Hilyers.  He
would have challenged attention in any company with his
amazing personality, the strange force that radiated from
him.  He had the long arms, short, thick legs and
enormous body of a gorilla, capped by a beautifully-modeled
head.  His forehead was high; his clean-shaven face was
very white; his jaw was square, without being prognathous.
But his eyes were his outstanding feature.  They were
large and vividly green like a cat's.
</p>

<p>
The man baffled you.  The expression of his face was
dreamy, preoccupied.  He had the appearance of a
thinker, a recluse.  But underneath his outward seeming
I sensed another self, lurking as if in ambush.  He was
handsome in an intellectual way.  Yet I found him
repulsive.
</p>

<p>
Hilyer, undeterred by Hugh's frosty greeting, dropped
his hand on this man's shoulder, and began introducing
him.  I noticed that the Englishman let his hand lie there
only a minute, and then almost snatched it away.
</p>

<p>
"Signor Teodoreschi, gentlemen!  The Italian chemist.
And my other friends, Countess Sandra Yassilievna and
Count Serge Vassilievich!  I ought to explain they are
brother and sister!"
</p>

<p>
This last with a well-bred leer.
</p>

<p>
"And Hilmi Bey, gentlemen!  If you knew your Levant,
you would recognize him without introduction."
</p>

<p>
I saw Nikka shift his attention at this from the two
Russians to the Levantine, an olive-skinned individual,
good-looking in a portly way, with a predatory beaked
nose, effeminate eyes and a sensual mouth.
</p>

<p>
"You see we're rather an international crowd&mdash;what?"
Mrs. Hilyer was drawling.  "Matter of fact, Lord Chesby,
we might muster another race or two."
</p>

<p>
"Very interesting, I'm sure," said Hugh, cold as ever.
"You won't mind if I present my friends to you as a
group?  Thanks.  This is Mr. Zaranko&mdash;and Mr. Nash."
</p>

<p>
"Not Mr. Nikka Zaranko?" exclaimed Mrs. Hilyer.
"Oh, I say, it is a treat to meet you!  How wonderfully
you play!"
</p>

<p>
And she wrenched Nikka away from his obvious intent
to probe the Levantine, and carried him off to a corner,
along with Vassilievich, a slim-waisted, old-young man,
with a hard, dissipated face.  Hilmi, after a look around,
joined the gorilla-like Italian, who was turning the pages
of a review on the table, with occasional flashing glances
about the room.  Montey Hilyer was volubly describing
the prospects of the racing season to Hugh, and I was
left by process of elimination to entertain the Countess
Sandra Yassilievna.
</p>

<p>
I think both Hugh and Nikka envied me the chance.
She was a dark girl, with great, sleepy, almond-shaped
eyes and a sinuous, willowy figure.
</p>

<p>
"You're an American, aren't you?" she said with a
very slight accent.  "How do you happen to know Lord
Chesby?"
</p>

<p>
I explained to her.
</p>

<p>
"He went to New York to earn his living!  Ah, that is
an old story, Mr. Nash.  Look at my brother and me!
Exiles!  Forced to turn our hands to whatever we can
do.  The Old World is a sad place these days."
</p>

<p>
I felt like telling her that I didn't believe it would
hurt her sort to do a little work, but instead I asked her
what she did do.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anything," she replied evasively.  "Secretarial
work when I can get it.  And you?  What shall you and
your friends do now?  But I suppose you will help Lord
Chesby enjoy the life of an English country gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"For a while, yes," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"And then?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  America, I suppose.  One must earn a
living."
</p>

<p>
"So you would leave him&mdash;Lord Chesby, I mean?"
</p>

<p>
I began to have a disagreeable feeling that I was being
pumped.
</p>

<p>
"I can't stay here forever, you know," I retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but of course!  And Lord Chesby?  Will he
marry an heiress, an American, perhaps?  But no!  He
does not need money, they say."
</p>

<p>
"'They say' a great many things," I commented.
</p>

<p>
"It may be he did ill to leave America," she suggested.
"One is so safe there.  In Europe, who can say what the
future holds?  Russia is chaos.  Turkey torn by war.
Eastern Europe boiling.  Germany thirsting for vengeance.
Ah?  Mr. Nash, were I an American I should stay
at home."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds almost like a threat," I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"God forbid!" she ejaculated with true Russian piety.
"It is that I envy you your security.  All Serge and I
can do is to wait and plot and plot and wait."
</p>

<p>
"Are you staying in England?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Only temporarily.  We shall be in Paris shortly.
Perhaps you would care to call when you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't any present intention of going to Paris," I
cut in.
</p>

<p>
"I can't believe you," she replied.  "Don't all good
Americans expect to go to Paris when they die?  Perhaps
you will travel elsewhere, no?"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged my shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You Americans are so venturesome," she sighed.
"One never really knew you as a people until the War."
</p>

<p>
I happened to look up at that moment, and surprised
the Italian in one of his lightning surveys of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Your friend there seems exclusive," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he?" she said hastily.  "He speaks no English,
and he is sensitive about it.  He talks little in any case.
These scientists, you know."
</p>

<p>
Hilmi Bey left the Italian's side, and sauntered over
to us.
</p>

<p>
"A beautiful old room," he said.  "Has it any history?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the oldest part of the present building," I told
him.  "I understand it represents a reconstruction
during Elizabeth's reign."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Faultless taste, isn't?"  He swung around on
me.  "They tell me you are an architect.  You must
appreciate such a good job."
</p>

<p>
The fellow spoke very pleasantly, and yet there was
something about him that aroused in me a continual
desire to punch his face.
</p>

<p>
"You can't beat the old people who worked slowly and
lovingly," I answered, forcing myself to be civil.
</p>

<p>
"That is a gorgeous fireplace," said the Countess.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes," he agreed, with his absurdly broad pronunciation.
"Rather a quaint verse there, too, I see.  How
does it run?"
</p>

<p>
He picked it out slowly, with some help from the
Russian girl.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Deuced odd!  What does it all mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the slightest idea," I said.  "Nor has anybody
else.  It seems like a gratuitous slap at a certain
religion, and as the author of the lines was noted for her
religious bias, that is probably as good an explanation as
any other."
</p>

<p>
Our conversation had attracted the attention of the
others, and Mrs. Hilyer drew Nikka and the Count in
front of the chimney-piece.
</p>

<p>
"You don't suppose there could be some secret
meaning to those words, do you?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd pick it out for me," I countered.
</p>

<p>
That was a query I had often put to myself.
</p>

<p>
"A key to something else, you know," she went on.
"Our ancestors were fond of that sort of thing.  They
loved mystery, and life wasn't as safe in those days as it
is in ours.'
</p>

<p>
"It's perfectly thrilling," cried the Countess.  "This
is just the kind of room to house some wonderful
secret&mdash;or perhaps a tragedy."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, her meaning is successfully concealed,"
I said.  "Always supposing she had a meaning."
</p>

<p>
I felt something behind me, and turned my head.  The
Italian had left the table in the center of the room and
moved up to the fringe of our group.  His green eyes,
flaring with an uncanny vital force, were intent upon
the rhyme on the overmantel.
</p>

<p>
"Humph," I thought to myself, "you may not be able
to speak English, but you appear to be able to read
it."
</p>

<p>
He growled something in an undertone to Mrs. Hilyer,
and she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Fascinating as your room is, I am afraid we must leave
you, Lord Chesby," she called over to Hugh.  "Signor
Teodoreschi had just reminded me we have to put him
on the London train before we drive home."
</p>

<p>
"I'll have your motors called up," returned Hugh
impassively, as he and Hilyer joined the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
He rang and gave the necessary orders to Watkins.
</p>

<p>
"You really must come over and have a bit of bridge
with us," Mrs. Hilyer bowled along merrily.  "Of course,
I know you are in mourning, but even so, you ought not
to deny yourself all pleasure.  Any evening at all.  Do
make it soon.  So glad to have met you, Mr. Zaranko.  I
can't tell you how sorry I am you won't play for us.
Mr. Nash, I've hardly had a word with you, but we'll better
that over at Little Depping, won't we?"
</p>

<p>
The Countess extended her hand to me.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will accept Mrs. Hilyer's invitation," she
said, her eyes glowing softly.  "It's such a pleasure to
meet Americans.  I'd love to ride with you one day this
week."
</p>

<p>
"I'll ring you up," I prevaricated, feeling very much
like doing it, if the truth be known&mdash;she had a way with
her, that girl.
</p>

<p>
"And don't forget that tip on Krugersdorp for the
St. Leger," I heard Hilyer insist to Hugh.  "I'm not
so sure about the Derby.  When you run over to see us,
I'll let you have a look at a sweet little filly I'm
grooming for steeplechase work.  You aren't takin' on any
hunters, are you?  I've&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By the way," Hugh interrupted.  "I meant to ask
you: did any of your people see strangers around here
the morning of my uncle's funeral?"
</p>

<p>
I was amazed at the sudden silence that gripped the
room.  The Italian, Teodoreschi, already in the doorway
after a curt nod of farewell, stopped dead and stared hard
at Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"You see," Hugh continued, "I heard one of your cars
was seen on the London Road in back of the park, and
if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear fellow," exclaimed Hilyer, "what's the
trouble?  There are always strangers passing through
Chesby.  You've got two trunk highways, remember."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," agreed Hugh.  "But I'm anxious to know
whether any strangers were seen that morning, especially
strangers on foot."
</p>

<p>
"Not that we've heard of," responded Mrs. Hilyer
promptly.  "All of us were at the funeral.  And if the
servants had noticed anything queer, I'm sure they would
have reported it to me."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Hugh.  "Would it be too much trouble
for you to inquire of them, just the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  D'you mind telling us what happened?"
</p>

<p>
The whole company crowded closer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing much," answered Hugh deliberately,
"except we had reason to suppose the house had been
entered."
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" protested Hilyer.  "That's a go.
We've never had anything like that before in the County.
But with so many men out of work, and the unrest and
whatnot, I suppose it's no more than to be expected."
</p>

<p>
"Did you lose anything, Lord Chesby?" inquired Hilmi
Bey.
</p>

<p>
"I think not."
</p>

<p>
The Countess Sandra Vassilievna permitted an artistic
shudder to undulate her figure.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bozhe moi</i>, Maude!" she cried.  "Do you bring us
into your rural England to risk death from burglars?  I
prefer the Bolshevists."
</p>

<p>
Several people laughed.
</p>

<p>
"All the same, it's no joke," answered Mrs. Hilyer.
"Thanks for the warning, Lord Chesby.  We'll let the
dogs loose around the house after this at night."
</p>

<p>
Teodoreschi, still standing in the doorway, rasped a
single sentence, and passed out.  The others flocked after
him like hounds over whom the huntsman cracks his whip.
Mrs. Hilyer and the Countess waved a last good-by, and
Watkins closed the door on them.
</p>

<p>
Nikka and I looked at one another, and burst out
laughing.  Hugh, with a muffled curse, threw up the
nearest window.
</p>

<p>
"Let's have some fresh air," he said.  "That scoundrel
Montey Hilyer makes me feel dirty.  He and his tips!
And we must come over and play bridge!  Yes, and
roulette, too, I suppose, with a wired wheel.  I say, you
two, do I look like such an utter ass?"
</p>

<p>
"They were a queer crowd," I admitted.  "That
countess wasn't bad-looking, though."
</p>

<p>
"I noticed you stuck to her," insinuated Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, she singled me out.  I think she was trying
to pump me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Hilyer didn't ask me any questions, I'm bound
to say," returned Hugh.  "He was too busy with his
beastly gambling anecdotes, and crooked dope.  What did
you make out of them, Nikka?"'
</p>

<p>
Nikka lit a cigarette before he replied.
</p>

<p>
"I think they are a party of polite thieves," he
answered at last.  "At least, some of them.  The Italian
I made nothing of."
</p>

<p>
"He didn't talk any," said Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"They said he couldn't speak English," I put in.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't notice, then, that he was listening to
everything that was said," observed Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"No, but I saw him read the rhyme up there over the
fireplace.  He gave me the shakes."
</p>

<p>
"Who was the Bey person?" inquired Hugh.
</p>

<p>
Nikka's lip curled.
</p>

<p>
"That fellaheen cur!  I know the breed.  They live by
graft and worse.  If we go to Paris I think I shall make
inquiries about some of them.  I know persons at the
Prefecture of Police who ought to have their dossiers."
</p>

<p>
We fell silent, as Watkins, the company out of the way,
brought in tea.
</p>

<p>
"How did they get on the subject of that verse of Lady
Jane's?" demanded Hugh suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"It was the countess and Mrs. Hilyer," I explained.
"They saw it, and insisted on reading some hidden
meaning into it."
</p>

<p>
As I spoke I looked up again at the overmantel where
the Gothic characters showed dimly in the light from the
smoldering logs and the rays of the sunset.  I conned over
the four lines deliberately.  "Ye Prior's Vent."  The
last three words seemed to jump out at me.  "Some secret
meaning....  A key to something else, you know."  Mrs. Hilyer's
phrases reëchoed in my brain.  I studied the
rhyme a second time.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh," I said suddenly, "d'you happen to have with
you the copy of that other verse of Lady Jane's?"
</p>

<p>
He produced it from his pocketbook, without speaking.
We had read over the copy of the Instructions a score of
time since our arrival at Chesby, but none of us had
recurred to Lady Jane's whimsical effort.
</p>

<p>
I spread the copy before me:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Putte downe ye Anciount riddel<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Decente, Seemelie ordour.<br />
  Rouse, O ye mystick Sybil,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vex Hymme who doth Endeavour,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor treate Hys effortte tendour.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And in the winking of an eyelid the cipher leaped out
before me.  I did not reason it out.  It just came to
me&mdash;when I saw the VE in the next to the last line, I think.
</p>

<p>
"I've got it!" I shouted, and I sprang up and danced
across the hearth, waving the paper in my hand.  "I've
got it!"
</p>

<p>
Hugh and Nikka regarded me in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Got what, you silly ass?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"It&mdash;the secret!  The key!  The cipher!  The treas&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But even as I started to say that, I thought better of it.
</p>

<p>
"No, that's going too far," I panted, breaking off in
my mad dance.  "I've got something, but how much it
means is another matter."
</p>

<p>
Hugh pulled me down beside them.
</p>

<p>
"Talk sense, Jack," he ordered.  "Show us your&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Here!"  I shoved the copy of Lady Jane's doggerel in
front of him and Nikka.  "Now watch!"
</p>

<p>
I took a pencil and drew it through all except the first
letters of the first and last words in each line.  So:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-064"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-064.jpg" alt="verse with scratched-out words" />
</p>

<p>
The result, of course, was:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  P &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    r<br />
  I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    o<br />
  R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    S<br />
  V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    E<br />
  N &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    t<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Prior's Vent!" gasped Nikka.  "He <i>has</i> found something!"
</p>

<p>
And his eyes, too, sought the verse carved on the
over-mantel.
</p>

<p>
"Up there, too!  It can mean only one thing."
</p>

<p>
"That the secret to the location of the treasure is in
the Prior's Vent!" I added triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"Or can be reached through the Prior's Vent," amended
Nikka.
</p>

<p>
Hugh, who had been in a brown study, aroused himself,
and peered at the mass of the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not trying to belittle Jack's discovery," he said
slowly, "but you chaps must remember that we don't
know where or what the Prior's Vent is."
</p>

<p>
"Except that you may take it for certain it is in this
room," replied Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"And that perhaps the fireplace has something to do
with it," I suggested.
</p>

<p>
Hugh shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Jack, that won't wash.  You, yourself, have
measured that chimney area, and we all agreed there
wasn't space inside it for a secret chamber.  If I thought
there was, I'd tear it down.'
</p>

<p>
"Hold on," counseled Nikka.  "Easy does it.  For the
first time we've got something to go upon.  Let's chew
it over for a while, and see what we can make of it."
</p>

<p>
We chewed it over until bedtime without reaching any
decision.

CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
THE FIGHT IN THE GUNROOM
</h3>

<p>
It was a long time before I went to sleep.  Lady
Jane's cipher and its inconclusive information kept
buzzing through my head.  But at last I dozed off and
dreamed of fat monks who popped out of a round hole
in a courtyard in endless succession until one of their
number, stouter than the rest, became wedged in the
opening.  He babbled profanely in Latin, and I started to go
to his aid&mdash;and waked up.
</p>

<p>
The night was very dark, and there was not even a hint
of starshine to light the room.  A dog was barking on the
Home Farm just outside the park enclosure, but not
another sound broke the silence.  I rolled over, and shut
my eyes, and promptly sat up in bed.  I thought I had
heard another sound.  What it was I could not say.  It
was very faint, a gentle burring rip.
</p>

<p>
I swung out of bed, reached for a candle, thought better
of it, and crossed to the door communicating with Hugh's
room.  It was ajar, and as I poked my head in, I could
hear his gentle breathing.  Nikka's room, beyond his, was
quiet.  Outside of us three, only Watkins slept in that
part of the house.  The servants' quarters were in the
rear over the kitchens.
</p>

<p>
My first instinct was to laugh at myself, but I opened
the door from my room into the hall and listened there.
At first, I heard nothing.  Then it seemed to me that I
detected a creaking, as of subdued footfalls.  I strained my
faculties in tense concentration, but the creaking was not
repeated, and I began to believe that my imagination was
playing tricks with me.
</p>

<p>
To make sure, I crossed the hall in my bare feet, and
listened at Watkins's door.  Watkins, I regret to say,
snored quite audibly, and I was inclined to suspect that
he had been responsible for arousing me.  But I could
not quell the uneasiness which possessed me.  I started to
call Hugh and Nikka, and stopped with my hand raised
to knock on Nikka's door.  It would be a fool stunt to
wake them for nothing but my own fancies.
</p>

<p>
After a moment's further hesitation, I crept downstairs
into the entrance hall, groping my way in the pitch
darkness.  Feeling more than ever like a fool, I looked into
the dining room and music room.  I had just stepped back
into the hall when a chink of light shone out of the short
passage that led from the hall into the Gunroom.  It
flickered away, and returned.
</p>

<p>
Wishing now that I had taken the automatic that lay on
the table beside my bed, I stole into the Gunroom passage.
I still thought I might have to deal with one of the
servants.  In fact, I didn't think very much of anything,
except the necessity of discovering the identity of the
intruder.
</p>

<p>
The door of the Gunroom opened into the passage.
It was ajar, but not sufficiently to permit me to see
inside.  I drew it cautiously toward me.  The chink of
light was more pronounced.  A brief mutter of voices,
hoarse and restrained, reached my ears.  As the crack
widened, I adjusted my eye to the opening and peered
in.
</p>

<p>
The Gunroom was a pool of shadows, save only in front
of the fireplace, where a single ray of light played upon a
preposterous figure crouched on the mantle-shelf.  The
light came from an electric torch in the hand of a second
figure outlined against the dying coals of the woodfire on
the hearth.  They mumbled back and forth to each other,
and now I caught once more the faint noise like the
prolonged ripping of tough cloth which had attracted my
attention upstairs.
</p>

<p>
The light flashed on steel, and I realized that the figure
on the mantle-shelf was working with a small saw on the
panel of the over-mantle containing Lady Jane's verse.
As I watched, he suspended his efforts and barked
impatiently at his assistant.  The ray of light quivered and
shifted upward.  For a fleeting section of a second it
traversed the figure on the mantle-shelf and focussed
momentarily on his head and shoulders.
</p>

<p>
I gasped.  The figure on the mantle-shelf was Professor
Teodoreschi, the Italian chemist who had accompanied
the Hilyer's party.  There was no mistaking the tremendous
shoulders, the long ape-arms, the pallid face, with
its high forehead and heavy jaw.  He wore the same
costume of shooting-coat and knickerbockers that he had
had on in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
In my amazement my hand tightened involuntarily its
grip on the door, which swung out past me with a loud
groan.  Another beam of light flashed from the shadows
close by, focussed on me and snapped off.
</p>

<p>
"Amerikansky!" cried a man's voice.
</p>

<p>
I heard him leap through the litter of furniture, and
dimly saw him fling his torch at me.  It crashed against
the door, and I snatched up a chair, stooped low and lashed
at his legs.  He tumbled in a heap.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh!  Nikka!" I shouted at the top of my lungs.
</p>

<p>
I had my hands full on the instant.  The man who had
flung the torch at me was already scrambling to his feet.
The gorilla-like Italian had jumped from the mantle-shelf
with the alert energy of a big cat.  He and the man
who had been helping him were now dodging towards me.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ne tirez pas!</i>" hissed Teodoreschi in throaty accents
that were vaguely familiar.  "<i>Percez!  Attende</i>, Serge,
Vlada!  <i>Percez!  Poignardez!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The Italian's helper reached me first.  I saw his knife
in his hand, and struck out with my fist.  Being a
knife-fighter, it was what he least expected, and he went over.
I ran behind the large center table, and as the Italian
and the other man closed in, I reared it on end and
toppled it at them.  They jumped apart, and I found
opportunity to heave another chair at the chap I had just
knocked down.
</p>

<p>
But I was in for a bad time.  Teodoreschi and the man
who had first rushed me were ugly customers.  I evaded
them, slipped behind the couch that stood in front of the
fireplace and tried to make for the window.  They headed
me off, and I drove a right hook to the jaw of my original
foe that sent him reeling.  Then the Italian was on me
like a human juggernaut.  He swept aside my blows as
though they were harmless, folded me in his great arms and
tossed me from him.  I spun across the hearth into the
fireplace, and brought up on all-fours in the ashes.
</p>

<p>
Every tooth in my head was jarred by the crash, but
I had no time to think of pain.  I heard the guttural snarl
of the gorilla-man behind me, and looked up to see his
knife descending in a stab that was aimed inside my
collarbone.  Desperate, I threw myself backward against
his legs, and he fell on the couch.  Yet he was up again
in an instant, and chopping at me, with foam dripping
from his lips.
</p>

<p>
I had to run, and as I ran, I kicked the fire-irons in
his way.  They tripped him and his knife went hurtling
across the room into a bookcase.  But I could not escape.
His companions herded me back towards him, and presently
I was battling to avoid his clutch.  Once within his
reach, I was helpless as a child.
</p>

<p>
His arms wrapped me like cables; his wicked green eyes
blazed at me with insane ferocity; his teeth gnashed at
my throat.  And his two friends hovered near, watching
for an opportunity to finish me with their knives.
</p>

<p>
Then I heard feet pattering in the hall, a cry of
encouragement.  I summoned all my strength for one last
struggle.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot!  Hugh!  Nikka!  Shoot!" I yelled.
</p>

<p>
Teodoreschi lifted me from my feet, and turned me face
upward in his arms.  I honestly think he meant to gnaw
through my throat.  His pallid cheeks gleamed with
sweat.  His eyes were utterly inhuman.  His mouth
dribbled saliva.  But an automatic cracked in the doorway,
and was followed by a choking cry.  He hesitated, glaring
down at me, and I could almost see the human intelligence
returning to his face.  There were two more shots, and he
slammed me on the floor, with a barking screech of
defiance.
</p>

<p>
The next thing I remember was Hugh pouring raw
Scotch whiskey down my throat&mdash;and how good it tasted.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get him?" I stammered.
</p>

<p>
"We got one fellow," answered Hugh grimly.  "Or
I should say, Nikka did."
</p>

<p>
I staggered to my feet with Hugh's arm around me.
In the doorway I saw Watkins, a nightshirt flapping
around his calves, forcing back a motley group of servants.
Nikka had picked up the electric torch which had been
flung at me, and was examining by its light the body of a
man that lay between the couch and the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
As Watkins closed the door, Nikka beckoned to him.
</p>

<p>
"Did they see this?" he asked shortly, pointing to the
body.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  None of them got inside, and it's quite
impossible to see be'ind the couch 'ere, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Oh, Hugh!"  Nikka turned to us.  "Hello,
Jack!  Do you feel yourself again?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm right as can be," I insisted, which was the truth.
"Nothing bothered me, except having the wind squeezed
out of me by that gorilla."
</p>

<p>
"What gorilla?"
</p>

<p>
"The Italian&mdash;Teodoresehi."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, was he in it?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh and Nikka exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"Well, take a look at this fellow," suggested Nikka.
</p>

<p>
He switched the torch on the body by the hearth.  There
was a red splotch over the heart.  The right hand still
clutched convulsively a long knife, with a slight curve near
the keen point of the blade.  The light settled on a dark,
thin, hooknosed face.
</p>

<p>
"Ever seen him before?" inquired Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"No," I admitted regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Watty!" called Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, your ludship."
</p>

<p>
Watkins maintained all his usual dignity of demeanor,
notwithstanding that he was in his nightshirt and bare
feet, with a snuffed-out candle in one hand and an
automatic in the other.
</p>

<p>
"Ever seen this man before?"
</p>

<p>
Watkins stooped, and almost instantly jerked erect.
</p>

<p>
"It's 'im, your ludship!  It's the man that told us 'e
came from you.  On the <i>Aquitania</i>, sir!  A just and
'Eavenly punishment, indeed, your ludship!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll take a little credit for it, if you don't mind,"
said Nikka, grinning.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, did you recognize the third man?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.
</p>

<p>
"The Italian was the only one whose face I saw.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, I had a glimpse of Number Three as he escaladed
through the window after Teodoreschi&mdash;I'll take your word
for the Italian!  He&mdash;Number Three, I mean&mdash;looked very
much like the Russian, the brother of that Countess you
were so smitten with."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't smitten with her," I denied indignantly.
"Here, Hugh, don't drink all that whiskey."
</p>

<p>
"I like your nerve," he retorted.  "Didn't I pour a
quarter of the bottle down your throat?"
</p>

<p>
"Be that as it may," I went on when he had surrendered
it, "I shouldn't be surprised if Number Three was the
Count.  Now I think of it, the Italian called 'Serge!' when
they first jumped me.'
</p>

<p>
"That would be right, then," agreed Nikka.  "Did he
call this carrion anything?"
</p>

<p>
He touched the dead man with his foot.
</p>

<p>
"He called 'Vlada!' at the same time."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds reasonable, too," said Nikka, deep in
thought.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"The man is a&mdash;what you would call a countryman of
mine.  He is a Gypsy.  I tell you, my friends&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off, and stared down at the body on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Why, this.  Our task grows as we draw nearer to
it.  I have said before that we face a gang of international
thieves.  But see how their importance swells.
Hugh, this man Hilyer&mdash;when all is said and done, an
English country gentleman, living to outward seeming
within the law&mdash;is one of them.  They have a pair of shady
Russian nobles, probably with ex-spy records.  We have
seen a Levantine financier with them.  We know they have
powerful connections in America.  We know they have
access to the criminal organization of the Gypsies.  We
have seen an Italian scientist&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's no more Italian than you are," I interrupted.
"He may be a scientist, but he's French."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he, then?" asked Nikka placidly.
</p>

<p>
"He is that same Toutou Hugh's uncle spoke of."
</p>

<p>
Hugh leaped up.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"I just know, that's all.  Yesterday afternoon I saw
him, although I did not recognize him, as he normally is.
He's fearsome enough in that mood, God knows!  Well,
a few minutes ago I saw him blood-crazed.  He wanted
to bite my throat out like a tiger.  Oh, he's Toutou, all
right."
</p>

<p>
Hugh's face grew bitter-hard.
</p>

<p>
"In that case," he said, "I am going to drive over to
Little Depping, and do a bit of killing on my own."
</p>

<p>
Watkins, without a word, deposited his snuffed candle on
the mantel-shelf next an open kit of burglar's tools, and
stepped up beside his master.
</p>

<p>
"You can't do that sort of thing, Hugh," I urged.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  He's a murderer, isn't he?  He killed my
uncle&mdash;butchered the poor old chap!  D'you suppose
Hilyer would dare to complain to the police?"
</p>

<p>
"What you say is right enough, Hugh," said Nikka
quietly, "but you forget that Hilyer's gang are hardly
the kind to give up without a fight, especially when the man
you want is their leader.  Also, I fancy you under-rate
your enemies' intelligence, if you suppose Toutou or
Teodoreschi or whatever his name is will return to Little
Depping."
</p>

<p>
"They prepared an alibi for him when they were here,"
I cried.  "Don't you remember?  When they were leaving,
Mrs. Hilyer said that they had to put him on the
London train before they drove home."
</p>

<p>
"And you can depend upon it that he took the train,"
added Nikka.  "He probably dropped off at another
station, and they met him with a car."
</p>

<p>
Hugh sat down gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are right," he admitted.  "But I should
like to shoot the swine."
</p>

<p>
"You are very likely to have the opportunity," Nikka
comforted him.  "That is, supposing you shoot first.
Now, see here, you chaps, what are we going to do with
this fellow I shot?  We can't have any publicity, and
while you may persuade servants not to talk about an
ordinary burglary, you can't hush them up if it includes a
killing."
</p>

<p>
"What's your suggestion?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Remove him secretly, and tell the servants that nothing
is missing and we don't want the affair talked about."
</p>

<p>
"The idea is good," assented Hugh.  "I'm not anxious
to have any more sensational interest attached to me,
But what can you do with him?  The body is in this
room.  It's got to be taken out.  You can't bury a body
without digging a grave.  That means leaving a trace.
Suppose some one should see us or suppose some one should
find the grave and investigate.  Mind you, old top,
whatever our motives, we are violating the law if we don't
report the man's death."
</p>

<p>
"There may be a way out of your difficulty," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Use the Prior's Vent."
</p>

<p>
They both looked at me as if I had gone mad.  Even
Watkins regarded me with stern disapproval.
</p>

<p>
"What are you talking about?" demanded Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"This is serious," reproved Hugh.  "Just because you
find a silly cipher&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am serious," I insisted.  "This has been an eventful
evening.  Among other things, I think I have found
the Prior's Vent."
</p>

<p>
Hugh shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p>
"There's been too much talk of secrets," he said.
"Watty, go and ring up Dr. North.  He must have hurt
his head in that mix-up."

CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
THE PRIOR'S VENT
</h3>

<p>
"Stay where you are, Watkins," I commanded.
"Let me have that torch, Nikka."
</p>

<p>
I turned it on the over-mantel.  An efficient
kit of burglar's tools reposed on the mantel-shelf under
the carven group of dancing monks, ale-horns and tankards
waving aloft.  The figure in the middle of the group had
a comically protruding belly that seemed to waggle as the
light played on it.  But what interested me was the small
flexible saw that was still fixed in the base of the panel
above the dancing monks.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see what our friends were up to?" I asked.
"That fellow Toutou has a keen mind.  He is somebody
to be reckoned with.  He saw what none of us saw, even
after we had worked out the cipher."
</p>

<p>
"What did he see?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
For answer I switched the light on to Lady Jane's
verse:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-075"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-075.jpg" alt="Lady Jane's verse" />

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"He saw that," I answered.  "And he jumped to conclusions
from it.  He knew, as we knew, that there is something
concealed in this house, probably in this room.
And he thought that that verse would not have been
placed just there unless there was a reason for it."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, I believe he was right!" exclaimed Hugh.
</p>

<p>
Nikka propped a chair against the mantle-piece, and
climbed on to the shelf.  The panel had been sawed through
on both sides and part of the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead," said Hugh.  "It's ruined anyway.  But
I swear I don't see how there can be an opening in back
there that wouldn't sound hollow when you rap over
it."
</p>

<p>
While I held the light on the panel Nikka sawed away,
and in fifteen minutes he had it detached from its beveled
frame.
</p>

<p>
"Come up here, Hugh, and help me with it," he said,
as he withdrew the saw, and Hugh climbed to his side.
</p>

<p>
They found a thin chisel in the burglar's kit, and with
this Hugh gently pried the panel loose.
</p>

<p>
"It has a stone backing," cried Nikka disappointedly,
as it came away.
</p>

<p>
In fact, we all experienced a profound feeling of
disillusionment when Watkins received the panel in his arms,
and the empty area of stonework was revealed, about four
feet long and three feet high.
</p>

<p>
"Too bad," said Hugh, jumping down.  "Especially as
we could have gotten a body through an opening that
size."
</p>

<p>
There came a yell of triumph from Nikka, and Watkins,
whose eyes had been straining at the opening, shouted:
</p>

<p>
"There is something there, your ludship!"
</p>

<p>
Nikka was digging furiously with the chisel at what
looked to be a dark stone in the very center of the
empty area.
</p>

<p>
"It's an inner wood panel," he grunted over his
shoulder.  "I can feel something behind it."
</p>

<p>
There was a splintering noise, and the "stone" fell
apart.  Behind it was a shallow recess, perhaps nine
inches square, completely filled by a rusty iron box.
Nikka levered the box out, and handed it to Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Your ancestress was a clever old person," he
commented, dropping beside us on the couch.  "Fancy her
figuring that the inner panel would prevent the recess
from sounding hollow when it was rapped."
</p>

<p>
The box was about three inches deep.  It was unlocked,
and Hugh lifted the cover without difficulty.  Inside
were two papers, very brittle and yellow from the heat
of the chimney.  The first was a torn fragment from a
household account book:
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Septr. ye 2nde, 1592.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And below this was written:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"And I sent Hyme forth of ye Vilage thatte Hee might not
have Chaunce to talk howbeeit Hee ys clousemouthed and Hath
littel Englysh."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was impossible not to laugh at the invincible
determination of Lady Jane.
</p>

<p>
"What did she do with the second box?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Probably used it in another mystery," chuckled
Nikka.  "What's the other paper, Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the real thing!  Great Jupiter, see what Toutou
missed!"
</p>

<p>
And he spread the second paper on his knee.  It was
short and to the point:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"To Hymne thatte hath Witte to rede Mye riddel.  Presse
atte ye One time ye Sfinxes headde and ye Monkes bellie.  So
wil ye Flaggin drop in ye Dexter side of ye Harth.  Thatte
whych you Seke you shal Discovour in yts proper Place.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"JANE CHESBY."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I flashed the electric torch on the mantle-piece.  "Ye
Sfinxes headde" was in the very center of the row of
Turks' heads, and veiled women that was sculptured along
the edge of the stone mantle-shelf.  "Ye Monkes bellie"
was the bit of carving that protruded from the center of
the bibulous group that had upheld the panel bearing
Lady Jane's verse.
</p>

<p>
"I've pressed both of those more than once," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"But not both at once," answered Nikka.
</p>

<p>
He bounded up, and drove his two hands, palm out,
against the projections.  There was a muffled thud in the
fireplace.  I sank on my knees, and trained the electric
torch inside.  On the "dexter," or right-hand side, in
the rear, yawned a hole some two feet square.
</p>

<p>
I crawled through the ashes, and thrust the torch over
the rim.  There was a sharp drop of three or four feet,
and then the beginning of a flight of stairs, heavily
carpeted with dust.  A damp, earthy odor smote my nostrils.
The others crawled in beside me.  Even Watkins pulled
his nightshirt around him and stuck his head in as far
as he could get.
</p>

<p>
"Ever seen that before, Watty?" asked Hugh, backing
out.
</p>

<p>
"Never, your ludship."
</p>

<p>
The valet's face was a study.
</p>

<p>
"Is late ludship, Mister Hugh, was frequently in the
'abit of being alone, as I daresay you know.  But 'ow in
the world could 'e have found it, your ludship, if he didn't
find out first about that?"
</p>

<p>
Watkins nodded toward the gaping hole in the over-mantle.
</p>

<p>
"I'm damned if I know," admitted Hugh.  "Maybe
we'll find out.  By the way, how do you suppose you close
the Vent?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka fingered the two projections, and the moment he
applied pressure the flagstone slapped up into place.
</p>

<p>
"There's some counterweight arrangement," he said.
"The fellow who designed this was a master-mechanic."
</p>

<p>
"Evidently," agreed Hugh.  "Well, you chaps, we are
another mile-stone farther on the road, but the first thing
we have to do is to get the corpus delicti safely
underground."
</p>

<p>
"Right," assented Nikka, "But we need clothes and
food.  You can't tell what we may run into."
</p>

<p>
For the first time I looked at myself, and burst out
laughing at the spectacle I presented.  My pajamas were
torn to shreds, and I was smutted from head to foot with
soot and ashes.  Hugh and Nikka were little better.
Watkins was as immaculate as a man in his night-shirt may be.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Hugh.  "Then Jack had best go
upstairs and wash, while Watkins gets dressed and fetches
our clothes.  In the meantime, Nikka and I can be
disposing of our friend here."
</p>

<p>
We adopted this plan, and Watkins also volunteered to
tell cook to start breakfast.  The curtains had been close
drawn over all the Gunroom windows, and I was amazed
to perceive on leaving it that the sun was rising.
</p>

<p>
When I came downstairs twenty minutes later, Hawkins
the butler, carrying a large tray, was knocking on the
Gunroom door.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take it," I told him.  "You go back to the kitchen
like a good fellow, and keep the maids quiet."
</p>

<p>
I knocked for several minutes without result, and finally
set the tray down, and banged the door with both fists.
</p>

<p>
"All right!  All right!" called a strangely blanketed
voice.  "Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack!"
</p>

<p>
Feet scuffled inside, and the door was jerked open by
Hugh, rather dusty and cobwebby.
</p>

<p>
"We were out under the Park," he explained.  "We
took that Gypsy down safely, and I came back ahead of
the others on the chance you might be trying to get in.
There's a regular passage, Jack.  It seems to go on and
on.  We didn't have time to follow it very far."
</p>

<p>
He set the table, which I had overturned, on its legs,
and I brought in the tray.  Then Nikka and Watkins
emerged from the fireplace, blinking owlishly, and we
three drew chairs up to the table, and Watkins served
breakfast as deftly as though we had not departed a
hair's-breadth from the ordinary routine of life.
</p>

<p>
"Have you had breakfast yet, Watty?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"No, your ludship."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, then, and eat."
</p>

<p>
Watkins looked like a man instructed to undress in
Piccadilly.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, your ludship&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, man."
</p>

<p>
"But, your ludship&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hugh pointed to a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, Watty," he said severely, "bring that chair
up, pour yourself some coffee and eat."
</p>

<p>
Watkins complied with an air of outraged decorum.
</p>

<p>
There was a knock on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that?" said Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"It should be 'Awkins with the quick-lime, your
ludship," answered Watkins, hastily pushing back his chair.
"'E had to 'ave it brought from the stables."
</p>

<p>
"Take it from him, Watty&mdash;and then come back here
and finish your breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Why quick-lime?" I asked, as Watkins received a
bulky, whitish-powdered sack through the half-opened
door.
</p>

<p>
"We can't very well dig a grave in stone," was Nikka's
grim comment.
</p>

<p>
Watkins dropped the sack on the hearth, and returned
to his breakfast.  He wanted very much to quit with one
cup of coffee, but Hugh ordered him back and insisted that
a man who had work to do required not less than four
slices of toast and three eggs.
</p>

<p>
"Bloated I'll be, your ludship," protested the valet.
"Oh, if you will 'ave it!"
</p>

<p>
"I will," said Hugh.  "You are going to be on guard
here, Watty, while we are gone.  Have you your
automatic?  Right O!  Don't let anybody in."
</p>

<p>
He took the electric torch, and dropped the sack of
lime down the hole in the fireplace.  We climbed after it,
one by one.  The first stairs were extremely steep and
the roof was so close that we had to stoop; but after we
had descended perhaps fifteen feet, they turned to the
right and the roof lifted to a little more than six feet.
</p>

<p>
"This is where the passage strikes off from the house,"
remarked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
The stairs continued to descend for another fifteen or
twenty feet, and then straightened out.  At the foot of
the last step lay the body of the Gypsy.  Hugh was carrying
the lime-sack, so Nikka and I picked up the dead man,
following Hugh, who lighted the way with the torch.
</p>

<p>
The passage was beautifully built, with an even floor,
and wide enough for one man to walk comfortably.
Despite a damp odor, it was not muddy, and there must have
been some means of ventilation, for the air was reasonably
fresh.  According to a compass on Nikka's watch-chain,
it trended across the Park towards the ruins of
the Priory.
</p>

<p>
The Gypsy's body was a clumsy load to manage in so
confined a space, and we halted every two or three hundred
feet to rest.  We estimated that we had walked a
kilometer when we noticed a gradual upward slope in the
flooring.  The passage turned a corner, and the light of
Hugh's torch was reflected on the rusty ironwork of what
once had been a massive door.
</p>

<p>
Of the wood only a pile of dust remained, cluttered about
the broken lock; but the great hinges still stretched across
the path, upholding a ghostly barrier of bolted darkness.
We deposited the dead Gypsy on the floor, and helped
Hugh to bend back the creaking iron frame.  Beyond
loomed a vast emptiness, a spreading, low-roofed chamber,
studded with squat Norman pillars that marched in dim
columns into unseen depths.
</p>

<p>
The torch scarcely could penetrate the heaped-up
shadows, but as our eyes became accustomed to the room's
proportions we realized that we stood on the threshold of
a mausoleum similar to the one in which we had seen
Lord Chesby laid to rest.  Hugh stepped across the stone
sill of the doorway, and swung the light back and forth
between the pillars.  Suddenly it glinted on metal.
</p>

<p>
We all pressed closer, staring at the picture that took
shape under the white glare.  On a stone shelf lay a
skeleton in armor.  The peaked helmet had rolled aside from
the naked skull, but the chainmail of the hauberk still
shrouded trunk and limbs.  Next to it lay a smaller
skeleton, clad in threads of rich vestments.  There was a
twinkle of tarnished gold cloth, a fragment of fur.  A
bygone Lord of Chesby and his lady!
</p>

<p>
"We are intruders in this place," I exclaimed.  "It
doesn't seem right, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
My voice rolled thunderously from roof to floor and
wall to wall and back again, and the pillars split the
echoes into parodies of words.
</p>

<p>
"Intruder&mdash;derr-rr-r&mdash;whirr-rrr-rr-r!  Place&mdash;pla-aay-ayy
ay-ay!"
</p>

<p>
"One feels indecent in being here," agreed Nikka.
</p>

<p>
Hugh frowned down upon the two skeletons.
</p>

<p>
"They wouldn't mind," he said.  "We have a reason
for coming."
</p>

<p>
And while the echoes had their will with his declaration,
he led us slowly around the circuit of the chamber.
</p>

<p>
Niche followed niche.  On shelf after shelf lay the
bones of men and women whose bodies had rotted ages ago.
On one moldered the skeleton of a man in clerical
raiment, with what had been a miter on his skull, some cadet
of the house who had entered the Church.
</p>

<p>
Halfway around we came to another shelf that held
two skeletons.  The inner, obviously a woman's, thrust
its poor bones through the tattered fabric that robed it.
The man wore an immense pot-helmet of the early type,
with eye-holes and nasals drilled in the fashion of a cross.
His chainmail was very finely-woven, and included mail
shoes that had collapsed pathetically on crumbled bones.
His gauntleted hands were clasped on the hilt of a long,
two-edged sword, which lay upon his chest with the point
between his feet.  His left arm supported a kite-shaped
shield that revealed traces of color beneath the over-lying
dust.
</p>

<p>
On his chest, just above the clasped hands, was an iron
box identical with the one which we had found behind the
panel of the over-mantle, the second of the "two boxes of
Flanders iron" which Conrad had furnished to Lady Jane.
</p>

<p>
Hugh switched his torch on the base of the shelf.  In
rough, angular Gothic characters we spelt the inscription:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  Hic Jacet<br />
  Hugh Dominus Chesbiensis<br />
  et<br />
  Edith Domina Chesbiensis<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The first Hugh!" exclaimed Hugh with a note of awe
in his voice.
</p>

<p>
And indeed, it must have been a moving experience to
view the flimsy relics of those two from whose loins he,
himself, had sprung through the resistless life impulse
prevailing over time and death down the procession of
the centuries.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a moment, and then reached out reverently
and removed the iron box from the mailed breast.  Handing
the torch to me, he raised the dingy cover.  Inside was
a chest of ebony, bound with silver, sound and whole.  It
was unlocked.  As Hugh lifted the lid, a sheet of paper
fluttered out and Nikka caught it.  Across the top was
engraved "Castle Chesby," and it was covered with fine,
cramped writing.
</p>

<p>
"It's Uncle James's record," said Hugh.  "After the
exultation of plumbing the mystery to be murdered like
a dog!  Poor old chap!"'
</p>

<p>
The note or record was whimsically brief and undated:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Last Thursday evening, in studying Lady Jane's doggerel
on the back of the Instructions, I suddenly perceived the cipher.
It occurred to me that the verse on the over-mantel in the
Gunroom must have some connection with this, and after several
days' examination, I fell upon the secret.  I say fell, advisedly.
In my interest in the task, I had shut myself up, and refused
luncheon, tea and dinner, and finally, late in the evening, I
sank against the mantle-shelf, weak and half-fainting.  My
hands, groping for support, struck the sphinx's head and the
monk's stomach.  I felt them give, heard the flagstone fall.
After that hunger was forgotten.  I descended the chimney
stairs and found my way here, the first Chesby to traverse the
Prior's Vent since that singular old ancestress of mine so
effectually concealed it, and with it, the clue to the treasure.  I
do not see now how I can fail to find the treasure, but I shall
leave the missing half of the Instructions, together with this
note, in Lady Jane's chest, so that, if I should fail, the
information may be available for Hugh.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"JAMES CHESBY."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"This was what he tried to tell&mdash;at the last," said
Hugh.
</p>

<p>
His voice choked.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old chap!"
</p>

<p>
"There is something peculiar about his finding the secret
in one way and our finding it in another so shortly
afterward," I said.
</p>

<p>
"The soothsayers of my people would call it a sign,
a premonition," replied Nikka, with a melancholy smile.
</p>

<p>
"Of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the removal of whatever curse or inhibition has
prevented the discovery of the treasure up to this time."
</p>

<p>
"Well, two men have died already since this last search
was begun," answered Hugh, fumbling in the chest.
"And who knows how many others have been killed on
its account?"
</p>

<p>
He drew out a bundle wrapped in decaying velvet cloth.
Within was a wrapping of silk, and under all a folded blank
sheet of parchment enveloping two other documents.  One
was a parchment, tattered and worn, which had evidently
been much handled.  It was jaggedly cut at the top as
though by a dull knife or some other instrument.  Its
surface was crowded with the same intricate Black Letter
script in mediæval Latin as comprised the Instructions in
the Charter Chest.  The writing was badly faded, and a
number of words in the lower right-hand corner had been
smudged by dampness at some remote time.
</p>

<p>
The second document was a pencilled translation of the
first in James Chesby's handwriting:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The Great Palace&mdash;or as some call it, the Palace of the
Bucoleon&mdash;is over against the Hippodrome and the Church of
St. Sophia.  In the Inner Court, which fronts upon the Bosphorus,
there is a door under the sign of the Bull.  Beyond the door
is a hall.  At the end of the hall there is a stair.  At the foot
of the stair there is a gate.  Pass through the gate into the
atrium which is off the Garden of the Cedars.  In the Garden
is the Fountain of the Lion.  From the center of the Fountain
take four paces west toward the wall of the atrium.  Then walk
three paces north.  Underfoot is a red stone an ell square.
Raise the ................................................

<p>
"... farewell, my son, and forget not the monks of
Crowden Priory and the plight of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
"Thine in the love of Christ and the Sainted Cuthbert,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"HUGH."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Beneath this Lord Chesby had scrawled:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The missing portion is not essential.  Below the stone is the
treasure.  That seems certain."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We looked at one another, hardly able to believe our
senses.  The thing had appeared so difficult, so unattainable.
And now it was almost within our grasp&mdash;or so we
reasoned in the first flush of confident anticipation.
</p>

<p>
"It's a question, of course, whether any portion of the
Palace of the Bucoleon remains," Nikka pointed out.
</p>

<p>
"But Uncle James seemed to have no doubt of that,"
answered Hugh.  "Do you remember, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
A wild shout bellowed from the mouth of the passage,
roared and clanged like a trumpet-blast and was shattered
by the echoes.
</p>

<p>
"Your lud'&mdash;Mis' Jack!  Mis' Nikka!"

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
HIDE AND SEEK
</h3>

<p>
Hugh slipped the penciled translation in his
pocket, swiftly rewrapped the Black Letter
original and stowed it in the ebony chest, and
refastened the iron box, which he returned to its former
place on the mailed breast of his dead ancestor.
</p>

<p>
"That's Watkins," he said.  "Something has happened
up above.  Come on, you chaps."
</p>

<p>
In the doorway he paused by the body of Toutou's
gangster.
</p>

<p>
"What about this?" he demanded.  "I won't have him
left in there&mdash;with those."
</p>

<p>
He gestured toward the silent forms that filled the
sepulcher.
</p>

<p>
"No need to," returned Nikka curtly, emptying the
lime-sack as he spoke.  "Leave him here."
</p>

<p>
We trotted on, and when we passed the first turn in
the passage, just beyond the wreck of the ancient door,
we saw a light that bobbed up and down in the near
distance.
</p>

<p>
"Your ludship!" wailed Watkins's voice through the
booming echoes.
</p>

<p>
"Steady on, Watty," Hugh called back.  "I'm here."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!  Oh, your ludship, I'm that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Watkins panted up to us quite out of breath.  He carried
a dwindling candle in one hand, and his usually tidy
garments were coated with dust.
</p>

<p>
"Must&mdash;apologize&mdash;ludship&mdash;appearance&mdash;fell&mdash;stairs,"
he began.
</p>

<p>
"Easy, easy," said Hugh comfortingly, and fell to
brushing him off.  "If it's bad news, why, it's bad news,
Watty.  If it's good news, it can wait."
</p>

<p>
"It was a lady, your ludship!"
</p>

<p>
We all laughed.
</p>

<p>
"A lady!" repeated Hugh.  "Bless my soul, Watty,
are you gettin' dissolute in your old age?"
</p>

<p>
"She 'ad nothing to do with me, your ludship,"
remonstrated the valet indignantly.  "Leastwise, I should
say, she 'ad no more to do with me than make a mock of
me and the pistol you gave me."
</p>

<p>
"How's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Took it away from me, she did, your ludship."  Watkins's
voice quivered with wrath.  "And tripped me on
me back.  Yes, and laughed at me!"
</p>

<p>
"A lady, you said?" demanded Hugh incredulously.
</p>

<p>
Watkins nodded his head.
</p>

<p>
"And hextremely pretty, too, if I may say so, your
ludship."
</p>

<p>
Hugh looked helplessly at Nikka and me.
</p>

<p>
"I say, this is a yarn!" he exclaimed.  "Watty, for
God's sake, get a grip on yourself.  Begin at the
beginning, and tell everything."
</p>

<p>
He grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Conceal nothin', you old reprobate, especially, if there
were any amorous episodes with this lady."
</p>

<p>
"Your ludship!  Mister Hugh, sir!"  Watkins's expression
was a study in injured innocence.  "You will
'ave your bit of fun, I suppose.  As for me, sir, if I was
for making love to some female I'd take one that was
not so free with her strength."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure it was a woman?" interrupted Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Judge for yourself, sir, Mister Nikka.  After you
gentlemen left me, I tidied up the room, and quite a time
had passed, I should judge, when I heard a click, and
one of the windows opened in the south oriel."
</p>

<p>
"That's the one Toutou and his man escaped through,"
I broke in.  "They probably fixed the lock."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely, sir.  I turned when I 'eard the click,
and the lady stuck 'er leg over the sill."
</p>

<p>
"Stuck her&mdash;" Hugh gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, your ludship.  She 'ad on riding-breeches.
A very pretty lady she was, your ludship," added
Watkins contemplatively.
</p>

<p>
"So you've said before," commented Hugh.  "And
what next?"
</p>

<p>
"I said: 'Who are you, ma'am?'  And she laughed,
and said: 'Oh, it's only me, Watkins.'  And I said:
'Well, ma'am, I'm sure I don't know 'ow you come to
'ave my name, but I really can't permit you to come in
'ere.  Please get down, and go around to the front door.'
</p>

<p>
"With that she 'opped over the window-sill, and stood
there, looking about 'er.  'Come on, now, if you please,
ma'am,' I said again.  And I'm sure, your ludship, I was
considerate of 'er all the way through."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet a pony you were," said Hugh sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  Thank you, your ludship.  She looked
around, as I said, and she walked over to the fireplace as
cool as a cucumber.  'I see they did find it, after all,' she
says, and she stooped and peeked in at the 'ole where the
stone 'ad dropped.  At that I knew she could be no friend,
so I poked the pistol at 'er, and said: 'I don't want to
'arm you, ma'am, but you'll 'ave to come outside with me.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh,' she says, 'you wouldn't 'urt me, Watkins.
You're a nice, kind, old valet, aren't you?'"
</p>

<p>
Watkins's voice throbbed with renewed indignation, and
we all three, the gravity of the situation forgotten,
collapsed on the dusty floor.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, go on," gasped Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"'Ow can I, your ludship, if you're laughing all the
time?" protested Watkins.  "Oh, well, you will 'ave
your fun!"
</p>

<p>
"So did she," I chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"She did, sir," agreed Watkins with feeling.  "She
came right up against the pistol, and put out 'er 'and and
patted my cheek like, and the first thing I knew, gentlemen,
she 'ad tripped me and grabbed the pistol from my
'and, and there was I, lying on the floor, and she with 'er
legs straddled over me, pointing the pistol at me, and
laughing like sin.
</p>

<p>
"'Get up,' she says.  And she went and sat sidewise
on the table, with the pistol resting on 'er knee.'
</p>

<p>
"What was she like, Watty?"
</p>

<p>
"She 'ad black hair, sir, and was dark in the face.
She wasn't big, but she was&mdash;well, shapely, you might
say.  And she 'ad a way of laughing with 'er eyes.  She
asked me where you were, and what you had found, and
I stood in front of her, and just kept my mouth shut.
'I might shoot you if you won't talk,' she says.  'And if
you do, there'll be those that will hear it, and you'll be
seen before you get away,' I told 'er.  'True,' says she,
'and I couldn't bring myself to do it, anyway.  You're too
sweet.  You can tell your master, though, that we're not
sorry he's found what he was looking for.  If we couldn't
find it, the next best thing was for him to find it.
Whatever he does, he will play into our hands.'
</p>

<p>
"Then she walked over to the window, and dropped
the pistol on a chair.  "'Ere,' she says.  'You might 'ave
me taken up for breaking and entering if I went off with
this.'  And she 'opped over the sill on to the lawn.  When
I got there she was in 'er saddle and riding away.  I
tried to telephone to the Lodge to 'ave 'er stopped, but
the wires were cut.  They must 'ave done it in the night,
your ludship.  'Awkins was unable to get through to any
of the village tradespeople this morning.'
</p>

<p>
"Was that all?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, your ludship.  I called 'Awkins, and told 'im to
stand in the front door, and send away anybody who
came.  Then I climbed down into the 'ole, thinking you
would wish to know what 'ad 'appened immediately, your
ludship."
</p>

<p>
"You did quite right, Watty.  I don't blame you for
what happened.  The lady must have been a Tartar."
</p>

<p>
Hugh turned to us.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me the lesson for us in this last experience
is that we have got to move rapidly if we are going to
shake off Teuton's gang," he said.  "They are fully as
formidable as Nikka warned us they would be.  We ought
to start for Constantinople this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"There's no question of that," assented Nikka.  "But
what are you going to do with the key to the treasure?
You have it in your pocket now, but it is a long journey
to Constantinople.  Suppose they steal it en route?  They
may have plenty of opportunities, you know.  Personally,
I am not sanguine of shaking them off.  Then, too, you
must remember that Constantinople is the human sink of
Europe, Asia and Africa, more so to-day even than
before the War.  It swarms with adventurers and dangerous
characters.  The refuse of half-a-dozen disbanded armies
make their headquarters there.  It will be a simple matter
for a gang like Toutou's to waylay you or search your
baggage."
</p>

<p>
Hugh flushed.
</p>

<p>
"I had thought of that," he said.  "Er&mdash;the fact is&mdash;Jack
has a cousin&mdash;a girl we both know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You mean you do," I interrupted sarcastically.  "I'm
only her cousin.  Have you heard from Betty?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, damn you!  She and her father are at the Pera
Palace&mdash;he's an archæologist-bibliophile Johnny, Nikka,
and an awfully good sort."
</p>

<p>
"And the girl?" inquired Nikka, with his quiet grin.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll meet her, too.  She's very different from
what you'd expect in a cousin of Jack.  Anyhow, she
knows about this treasure business, and she read of Uncle
James's murder, and she's most fearfully keen to be in
the game with us.  My suggestion is that I mail Uncle
James's translation of the key to her in Constantinople.
Nobody knows that she knows me or has any connection
with any of us.  She left New York before Uncle
James arrived.  So it would be perfectly safe in her
hands."
</p>

<p>
"And in the meantime, we'd better commit it to memory,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
The others agreed to this, and we read over the brief
transcript of the missing half of the Instructions until
we had the salient directions fixed in our minds.  Then
we retraced our steps through the passage, climbed out
of the Prior's Vent and sealed it again; and while Hugh
and Nikka motored down to the village post office with the
letter for Betty, Watkins and I saw to the necessary
packing in preparation for the journey.
</p>

<p>
We had bags ready for all four of us by lunchtime,
and arranged with Hawkins to send trunks after us to the
Pera Palace in bond.  When Hugh and Nikka returned
from the village, all that was necessary was to eat the meal,
issue final directions to the servants for the repairing of
the panel of the over-mantle&mdash;the removal of which we
represented to have been the work of the burglars&mdash;and
fill up the tank of the car.
</p>

<p>
With an eye to a possible emergency, we had arranged
in advance for a considerable supply of gold and negotiable
travelers' notes, and our passports, thanks to Hugh's
influence, had been viséd for all countries in southern and
eastern Europe.
</p>

<p>
"There's only one thing we lack," remarked Hugh,
as we drove out through the park gates.  "I want an
electric torch for each of us.  The one we captured came
in very handy this morning."
</p>

<p>
So we stopped at the shop of the local electrician in
the village, and Hugh went in to make the purchase.  He
was just resuming his seat in the car when another machine
drew up alongside, and Montey Hilyer waved a greeting.
</p>

<p>
"Thought you were going to stay in the County a while,
Hugh," he hailed.
</p>

<p>
Hugh stared at him with the concentrated iciness which
the English of his class attain to perfection.
</p>

<p>
"Are you touring?" continued Hilyer.  "Or going
abroad?  Seems to me I heard something this morning
about your taking a trip to Constantinople.  A favorite
hang-out of your uncle's, I believe.  Well, if you're
following the Dover road, you mustn't mind if I trail you.
I have no objection to a knight errant's dust."
</p>

<p>
Without a word, Hugh slipped in his gears and zoomed
off on first, scattering dogs and pedestrians right and left.
</p>

<p>
"Damn the scoundrel!" he ripped between clinched
teeth.  "How I wish I could show him up!  Who was with
him?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka and I both shook our heads.
</p>

<p>
"There were three people in the tonneau," answered
Nikka, "but the cover was up, and they were buried in
wraps.  Did you notice your pretty lady, Watty?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  I couldn't say."
</p>

<p>
All the way to Dover Hilyer's green car tracked our
wheel marks two or three hundred yards behind.  Once,
near Godmersham, Hugh speeded in an endeavor to shake
him off.  But Hilyer stuck to us without difficulty, and
ran up close enough to show his derisive grin at the end
of the spurt.
</p>

<p>
On the channel boat again we had the sensation of
being watched, although we could not have pointed to
any persons and accused them of spying; and certainly
none of the members of the Hilyer house party was in
evidence.  Hilyer, himself, called good-by to us from the
dock.
</p>

<p>
"Have a good time," he shouted genially.  "If you get
to Constantinople, you may see me later."
</p>

<p>
At Calais we passed the Customs and passport officials
expeditiously because both Hugh and Nikka were
personages&mdash;a doubtful asset, as we were soon to learn.  And on
the Paris train we actually thought that we had eluded
surveillance&mdash;until we rolled into the Gare du Nord and
started to disembark.  It was Nikka who discovered the
little red chalk mark on the door of our compartment, and
Watkins who spotted a furtive individual who slunk down
the corridor as we stepped into it, a rat-faced fellow of
the Apache type that had disappeared during the War
and somehow floated back with other scum to the surface
of peacetime life.
</p>

<p>
We were all of us familiar with Paris, Nikka and I
perhaps more so than Hugh.  And we drove to a small
hotel near the Louvre which is noted for its table, its
seclusion and its steady patronage.  Aside from the fact
that it is a little difficult to get a bath there, it is the best
hotel I know of in the French capital.  The proprietor
welcomed us as old friends, and we were provided with
the choicest fare and the most comfortable rooms he had
to offer.
</p>

<p>
The four of us were dog-tired&mdash;remember, we had been
steadily "on the prod," as Hugh said, since we wakened
in the early morning hours to repel Toutou's invasion, and
the nervous strain had been wearing.  But before we turned
in, after M. Palombiere's magnificent dinner, Nikka
telephoned a private number at the Prefecture of Police.
</p>

<p>
The result of his call was demonstrated when we went
down to breakfast the next morning.  A jaunty little man
in a top-hat and frock-coat, with spats and a gold-headed
cane, flew up to Nikka and embraced him in the center of
the lobby.  And Nikka introduced him to us as
M. Doumergue, Commissaire of the Police de Suretie, or
Secret Police.
</p>

<p>
Would he do us the honor of taking breakfast with us?
Mais, certainement!  It was a pleasure of the greatest to
have the company of M. Zaranko and his cher colleagues.
His regrets were unspeakable that he might not have an
extended opportunity to make our acquaintance, as he
understood from M. Zaranko that we must depart that
same day.  He had taken the necessary steps already to
dispense with the usual formalities for arriving and
departing travelers, and he had also examined the dossiers
of the individuals M. Zaranko had named.
</p>

<p>
This last was what especially interested us; and we
listened closely to the facts he recited from a notebook.
</p>

<p>
"Of Toutou LaFitte, Messieurs, but little can be said.
If you have seen him, then you have seen one whom no
police official can claim knowingly to have laid eyes on.
But we feel him, Messieurs.  We hear of him.  We sense
his manifold activities.  If the stories which others, like
yourselves, tell us are true, he is a genius, a monster.
He rules the criminal world.  He has the brain of a
statesman, the instincts of an animal.
</p>

<p>
"Hilmi Bey we know well.  During the war he found it
convenient to dwell in Switzerland.  He has been mixed
up in various shady coups, both in Egypt and in Turkey.
He has sources of income we have never been able to
discover.  Prior to this nobody has associated him with
Toutou.
</p>

<p>
"And this Russian pair!  Vassilievich and Vassilievna!
They are notorious as international spies.  Before the war
they worked in the German interest.  During the War, who
can say?  Had we caught them they would have been
shot out of hand.  But the War is over, I regret to say,
Messieurs.  They hold their titles of right, and undoubtedly
come of an honorable family or families.  For as to
their being brother and sister&mdash;tien!  Why worry about
the unessential?
</p>

<p>
"The Hilyers have been watched since before the War
on suspicion of being implicated in dishonorable
gambling transactions.  But in France, Messieurs, a wide
latitude is allowed in these matters, and so far, we have
not been able to catch them&mdash;how is it the excellent
Americans say?  Ah, yes, wiz zee goods.
</p>

<p>
"Is this of assistance?  I regret deeply I cannot add
more.  But if I can aid you in any way, if you are annoyed
in Paris or subjected to observation, pray call upon
me."
</p>

<p>
He bowed himself out.
</p>

<p>
"That's all very well," remarked Hugh, as we wandered
over to the newsstand in the lobby, "and his information is
valuable, Nikka, but we can't call on him officially!  If we
complain of being shadowed at the Prefecture of Police,
they will ask us the object of it; and if we tell them the
truth, you can be sure the secret will leak out.  Why, the
policeman who didn't use such information would be a fool!
No, lads, the only thing for us to do is to dodge our
trailers."
</p>

<p>
I shook the Paris edition of the <i>Daily Mail</i> in front of
him.
</p>

<p>
"How the devil can we dodge trailers?" I demanded.
"I just picked up this paper, and look at what I see on
the front page."
</p>

<p>
There under a two-line head was the following announcement:
</p>

<p>
"Lieut. Col. Lord Chesby, D.S.O., accompanied by
Mr. Nikka Zaranko, the famous violinist, and Mr. John Nash,
an American friend, crossed on the Calais boat yesterday
and arrived in Paris last night.  Lord Chesby recently
succeeded to the title under circumstances of very tragic
interest."
</p>

<p>
"There's only one thing to do," said Hugh.  "Where's
Watkins?  We'll collect him, and book for the first train
to Marseilles.  They'll expect us to go direct by the Orient
Express."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
STOLE AWAY
</h3>

<p>
We rather prided ourselves on our cleverness as
we sat back in a reserved compartment of the
Lyons-Mediterranean Express, and watched the
Tour Eiffel fade against the sky.  We had moved with
considerable celerity.  First, we had loaded ourselves and
baggage into waiting taxis in front of the hotel.  Then
we had driven in these to the Gare de l'Est, dodged in
and out of that whirlpool of life, and reëntered two other
taxis, which we had directed in a reasonless jaunt through
the central district of Paris.
</p>

<p>
Then Nikka and I had left Hugh and Watkins with the
taxis in a side-street near the Madeleine, and bought the
tickets at Cook's.  We had returned to the taxis by a
roundabout route, and resumed our crazy progress from
one side of the river to the other and back again, now
crawling up the slopes of Montmartre, now threading the
narrow ways of the Isle du Cite, now buried in the depths
of the Quartier, now spinning through the Bois.  We had
lunched at a roadhouse, and returned to the station just in
time to climb aboard the train.  And finally, instead of
risking the separation entailed by patronage of the wagons
lit, we had elected to seclude ourselves in a single
compartment and sleep as best we could.
</p>

<p>
Hugh voiced the sentiments of three of us, when he
stretched out his legs and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"What price Toutou's vermin now?  I jolly well bet
they esteem us artful dodgers."
</p>

<p>
Nikka smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too sure," he cautioned.  "Eluding detection
is their life-work.  We are only amateurs."
</p>

<p>
"Rats," grunted Hugh.  "Sherlock Holmes, himself,
couldn't have traced us, eh, Watty?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't see 'ow any one could 'ave followed
us, your ludship," replied the valet wearily.  "I don't
quite know where I am myself, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I fear you haven't any submerged criminal instincts,
Watty," chaffed Hugh.  "Now I find myself gettin' a bit
of a thrill out of this hide-and-seek stuff.  By Jove, I
almost wish we had the police after us, too.  That would be
a treat!"
</p>

<p>
"A fair treat!" groaned Watkins.  "I mean no disrespect,
your ludship, and it may be there's no call for
the remark, but glad I'll be when this treasure is safe
in the bank and we can go 'ome to Chesby."
</p>

<p>
We all laughed.
</p>

<p>
"How about dinner?" I asked.  "Shall we eat by
shifts or&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's the use?" returned Hugh.  "We haven't
anything that will do 'em any good, and besides, they're
peekin' into all the compartments of the Orient Express
at this moment."
</p>

<p>
So we adjourned together to the restaurant-car, dragging
Watkins with us, much against his will; and we ate a
jovial meal, all relieved by the relaxation in the strain
which had been imposed upon us and enjoying the comic
reluctance with which Watkins permitted himself to be
forced to sit at the table with Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Dammit, Watty!" Hugh finally explained.  "You're
not a valet on this trip.  You're a brother adventurer.
I don't want any valeting.  I'm taking you along for the
benefit of your strong right arm."
</p>

<p>
"All very well, your ludship," mourned Watkins, "but
if the Servants' 'All ever 'ears of it it's disgraced I'll be.
I couldn't 'old up me 'ead again."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take care of that.  And do you think we'd leave
you to eat by yourself?  Suppose that pretty lady of
yours came in and sat down beside you.  What would
you do?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd 'eave 'er out the window, your ludship," said
Watkins simply.
</p>

<p>
We loafed through dinner, and complete darkness had
shut down when we returned to our compartment.
</p>

<p>
"I say," exclaimed Nikka, as he switched on the light.
"Was your bag up there when we left, Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh studied the arrangement of the luggage on the
racks.
</p>

<p>
"Can't say," he admitted finally.  "But it ought to
show if it's been pawed over."
</p>

<p>
He hauled it down, and opened it.  Everything
apparently was in perfect order.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, though," he cried, pursing his lips in a low
whistle.  "Watty, you packed this bag.  Don't you usually
put razors at the bottom?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, your ludship."
</p>

<p>
"They're on top now.  So are my brushes.  Everything
in order, but&mdash;  What do you say to giving this train a
look-over, Jack?  If there are any familiar faces aboard
we ought to be able to spot them.  Nikka, you and Watty
can mount guard here and protect each other until we
come back."
</p>

<p>
Our car was about in the middle of the train, and at
my suggestion, Hugh went forward, while I followed the
corridor toward the rear.  I examined carefully the few
persons standing and talking in the corridors, and violated
Rule One of European traveling etiquette by poking my
head into every compartment door which was open.  But
I did not see any one who looked at all like any of the
members of Toutou's gang whom I knew.  In fact, the
passengers were the usual lot one sees on a Continental
through-train.
</p>

<p>
I was returning and had reached the rear end of our
car when I heard a scream just behind me and a door
crashed open.  I turned involuntarily.  A woman in black,
with a veil flying around her pale face, ran into the
corridor, hesitated and then seized me by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Monsieur!  My husband!  He is so ill," she cried
in French.  "He dies at this moment.  I pray you, have
you a flask?"
</p>

<p>
The tears were streaming from her eyes; her face was
convulsed with grief.  I reached for my flask.
</p>

<p>
"Calm yourself, madame," I said.  "Do you take this.
I will ask the guard to help in finding a physician."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no," she protested.  "He has fallen.  He is
so heavy I cannot lift him.  And he dies, monsieur!  Oh,
mon Dieu!  Mon Dieu!"
</p>

<p>
I slipped past her into the compartment, flask in hand.
One of the electrics was on, and by its light I discerned
the body of a man huddled face down on the floor in the
midst of a litter of baggage and wraps.  I dropped the
flask on one of the seats, and leaned over to hoist the man
up.  As I did so she reëntered and closed the door, still
babbling brokenly in French.
</p>

<p>
"If you will help me, please, madame," I suggested.
"He is very heavy, as you say."
</p>

<p>
"But gladly, monsieur.  If you will turn him over&mdash;so
that we may see if he breathes."
</p>

<p>
The man was breathing, stertorously, long, labored gasps.
I could see very little of him, only an unusual breadth of
shoulder and a sweeping black beard.  But I experienced
an odd sensation of distaste as I touched him, and snatched
my hands away.  The woman began to sob.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, monsieur, he will choke!  He will choke!"
</p>

<p>
I felt like a cur, and promptly braced my hands beneath
his chest.  I started to lift him&mdash;and my wrists were
caught in a human vice.  So quickly that I could not
follow his movements, the inert man on the floor had twisted
me down beside him, his knee was on my chest, my wind
was cut off, a pair of steel handcuffs fettered me, and
as I opened my mouth to scream a cotton gag was
thrust into place by the woman who had lured me in.
</p>

<p>
"Voilà!" she said complacently, knotting the cords of
the gag around my neck.  "Or if you'd rather have it in
American, Mr. Nash, you're it.  Here, Toutou, get off
him.  You won't help by crushing his chest in."
</p>

<p>
She gave my captor a shove, and he rose with a growl
and a menacing gesture of clawed hands to take a seat by
the door.  I could see now that he was Toutou or
Teodoreschi, cleverly disguised.  The black beard concealed
his intensely pallid face and fell to his waist.  A soft
cloth hat hid the fine contour of his skull.  His immense
chest was minimized by loose, ill-fitting clothes.  And the
evil green eyes, flaring with animal lusts, were ambushed
behind dark spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"Get up," said the woman.
</p>

<p>
She stooped and put her hands under my arm-pits,
exerting a strength amazing for her size.  I staggered up
and collapsed on the seat opposite Toutou and as far away
from him as I could get.  I was weak from the vigor of
his handling and the nausea his touch had aroused.
Inwardly, I cursed myself for a fool.  I had been neatly
trapped at the very moment I was priding myself on
being on the alert.
</p>

<p>
The woman sat down opposite me, tossed back the veil
which had been hanging loosely around her face, picked
up a vanity case and commenced to wipe a generous layer
of powder from her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
She was of a Latin brunette type, with masses of wavy
black hair, great lustrous brown eyes and a piquant beauty
of face.  As her profile was exposed to me my memory
was jogged awake.  She was Watkins's pretty lady!  And
I was reinforced in this conclusion when I recalled the
muscle she had exhibited in helping me up, the off-hand
expertness with which she had gagged me, performances
reminiscent of the way the valet had been tripped and
despoiled of his pistol.
</p>

<p>
After a muttered interchange of words with Toutou in
a language I did not understand, she fastened her gaze
on me, and evidently something of my thoughts was
reflected in my face, for she burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"You can't make me out!" she jeered in an unmistakable
American accent.  "You're not the first, Mr. Nash.  How
is old Watkins?  He knows Hélène, too, and I'll bet he
never wants to see me again.  I laugh whenever I think
of him lying there on the floor gaping up into his own
pistol.  And say, you were lucky that day.  I came near
fetching a bomb with me, and if I had I sure would have
piled it into that passage.  Where would you have been
then, eh?"
</p>

<p>
She chuckled impishly, and Toutou from the shadows at
his end of the compartment&mdash;as I came to find out, the man
had an animal's aversion for the light when his enemies
were present&mdash;snarled a sentence that was partly French,
partly something else.
</p>

<p>
"Your affectionate friend tells me to quit kidding and get
down to business," she interpreted with a smile.  "I'm
going to take that gag out, Mr. Nash, and Toutou is
going to sit beside you with his hand on the back of your
neck, and if you so much as start to yip he'll break it
just as if you were a chicken."  Her eyes glinted harshly.
"Do you get me?  That goes."
</p>

<p>
I nodded my head.  Toutou moved up beside me, and
a shiver wrenched my spine, as his hand unfastened the
gag and enclosed my neck.
</p>

<p>
"We are perfectly safe," she continued.  "You are
my insane husband.  We are Americans, and I am taking
you to relatives in Italy.  Toutou is the physician in
charge of the case."  She reached inside her bodice and
produced some papers.  "Here are your passport and a
medical certificate.  Everything is in order.
</p>

<p>
"The one question is: are you going to do business with
us willingly or must we make you?"
</p>

<p>
I moistened my lips.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," I answered as coolly as
I could.  "I haven't got anything you might want.  Search
me."
</p>

<p>
"I will."
</p>

<p>
She dug out every pocket.  She opened my vest, felt for
a money-belt, felt inside my shirt, took my shoes off,
examined them carefully by flash-light, and made sure I
had nothing in my socks.  She was a methodical person,
that lady.  Having searched me, she put everything back
in its proper place, drew on my shoes and laced them.
Then she sat back and stared at me.
</p>

<p>
"And there was nothing in the baggage," she commented.
</p>

<p>
I grinned.  But quickly subdued my amusement as
Toutou snarled beside me and his steel fingers pressed
until my neck was numb.
</p>

<p>
"None of that, Toutou," she ordered sharply.  "What
about your friends, Mr. Nash?"
</p>

<p>
"None of them has anything."
</p>

<p>
"But you found something.  You must have.  What was
it?"
</p>

<p>
She leaned forward, and her eyes bored into mine.  I
stared back uncompromisingly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to have to let Toutou hurt you," she
warned softly.
</p>

<p>
At that something in me burst into flame.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter what he does," I spat at her.  "He
can't make me tell you anything.  As a matter of fact, I
haven't anything definite, none of us has.  But if we had,
we wouldn't tell.  I'll die before I help your gang."
</p>

<p>
That sounds like stage heroics, but I was in an exalted
mood.  I could feel Toutou's grip on my neck, and I
imagined I didn't have long to live in any case.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a question of time," she went on.  "You
don't realize that you and your friends are alone in this.
You have a great organization against you.  You have as
much chance as the fly after he touched the flypaper.
All we have to do is to watch you, and at the worst we
can take the treasure away from you when you find it."
</p>

<p>
"Then why are you so anxious now?" I rasped with a
fair mimicry of Toutou's feline rage.
</p>

<p>
"'There's many a slip'&mdash;" she quoted.  "We don't
believe in leaving anything unnecessarily to chance.  You
know, you are in a hopeless position, my friend.  Why
not talk sensibly?  We can easily get rid of you and
your friends, if we care to."
</p>

<p>
"You'll find it harder, the longer you delay," I flashed
at her.  "You are educating us."
</p>

<p>
She laughed as merrily as a convent schoolgirl.
</p>

<p>
"So I see."  She leaned closer coaxingly.  "Now, just
between the two of us&mdash;we're Americans, aren't we?&mdash;what
did you find behind the chimney?  After all, it
was Toutou who really saw the point first."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," I agreed, "but we would have seen it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you would!  Then what did you find?  Come,
let's get this over with!  We'll make an accommodation.
Think&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a buzz of voices in the corridor.  I heard a
dry official monotone, then Hugh's clipped English French
and Nikka's smooth accent.
</p>

<p>
"But he must be on the train, Monsieur&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There can be no question he is in one of the cars.
What objection&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There are people who sleep, women who&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But surely we can search&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The woman opposite me hissed one swift sentence to
Toutou, and rose, crouching towards the door.  Hugh's
voice, tense and passionate, thundered over the dispute:
</p>

<p>
"I don't give a damn for your rules!  My friend is
missing!  I'm going to look&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A hand rattled the knob of the door.  Hélène ripped off
her waist, dropped her skirt to the floor, and tumbled her
hair over her shoulders&mdash;all in two consecutive movements.
As she unlocked the door, she clutched her lingerie about
her.  Toutou reached up one hand, and twitched off the
single light; his other hand compressed my neck and throat
so that I could hardly breathe.  Hélène, herself, pushed
open the door.
</p>

<p>
"Why the disturbance, messieurs?" she questioned silkily
in French with the Parisian tang.  "In here we have
illness.  Is it necessary&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
One look was enough for them, I suppose.  It would
have fixed me, I know.  I heard Hugh's boyish gasp, and
Nikka's apology.
</p>

<p>
"It was a mistake, madame.  A friend is missing.  We
thought&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Here there are only ourselves," she assured them
holding the door wider.
</p>

<p>
Hugh cursed bluntly in Anglo-Saxon, and the guard
joined his voice in hectic phraseology.  Hélène slowly
reclosed the door.
</p>

<p>
"The light once more, Toutou," she whispered, and
then she sank on the seat and laughed as she had before
like a schoolgirl on a lark.
</p>

<p>
Toutou's face was demoniac despite beard and glasses.
Hélène saw the purple flush on my cheeks, my straining
nostrils.
</p>

<p>
"Beast!" she hissed.  And she slapped him with her
bare hand.  He cowered before her.  She snatched the gag
from my lap, and readjusted it.  "Go!"  She pointed
her finger toward the other end of the compartment, and
Toutou shambled away cat-fashion.  "He will murder you
yet, Mr. Nash," she said cheerfully.  "And I don't want
you to get it into your head that I am going to keep on
saving you indefinitely."
</p>

<p>
She rearranged her hair, picked up her waist and skirt,
and put them on as casually as though she was in her
boudoir.
</p>

<p>
"This writing that you found," she resumed her
questioning, "is it definite?  You may nod or shake your
head."
</p>

<p>
I did neither.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she answered patiently.  "We will try
you further."
</p>

<p>
And for two hours she shot questions at me, attacking
the problem from every conceivable angle, always with
her eyes glued on my eyes, always vigilant for any sign
of acquiescence or denial.  At last Toutou barked an
observation at her, and she leaned back a trifle wearily.
</p>

<p>
"We approach Lyons," she said.  "I shall let you go
this time, Mr. Nash, principally because if we killed you
it might frighten your friends away.  Above everything,
if we cannot learn the secret first, we must get you to
Constantinople."
</p>

<p>
Toutou took from one of their bags a length of stout
rope, and tied my legs from ankle to knee.  The train
was already whistling for the station yards.  Hélène
donned hat and furs, and patted my shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you were with us, my friend.  Ah, well, one
wishes for the moon.  Be of a stout heart, and remember
that Hélène de Cespedes has saved you from the knife.
I fancy we shall meet again, and as I said, I cannot
promise always to be so kind-hearted."
</p>

<p>
She let Toutou collect their two bags, saw him to the
door and then switched off the single light.  They went
out, the door closed, and I was in darkness.  I strained
at my bonds, but without success.  Suddenly, the door was
reopened.  The head of Hélène de Cespedes showed against
the lights in the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"Here is the key to those wristlets," she whispered,
sliding it along the seat toward me.  "Your friends can
unlock them when they find you.  I don't believe in being
too hard on an enemy&mdash;not when you don't have to be.
Well, so long, boy."
</p>

<p>
I chuckled to myself as the door clicked the second time.
She was a character, and no ordinary woman, judging by
her prowess in curbing Toutou's savage lusts.  I was still
reflecting on the amazing three hours I had experienced
in that railway compartment, when the brakes took hold,
and the train slowed to a stop between the brightly-lighted
platforms of the Lyons station.  There was the
customary clatter of arriving and departing passengers.
Footsteps sounded in the corridor outside; a hand
wrenched at the door; and a guard bundled in, with two
people behind him.  As he turned on the light his face was
a study in consternation.  The two people with him bolted
pell-mell into the corridor, shrieking in terror.  The guard
stood fast, and stared at me, stroking his chin.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sacré bleu!</i>" he muttered to himself.  "Name of a
Boche, the mad Englishman was right!  I believe they
have murdered his friend!"
</p>

<p>
But then I wriggled to attract his attention to the fact
that I was alive, and the consternation on his face changed
to cunning.
</p>

<p>
"But no," he reflected aloud.  "It may be this is a
criminal.  Are there, perhaps, gendarmes in company with
it?  It is for the <i>chef de gare</i>&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But at that moment Hugh, attracted by the rumpus
the two startled passengers were making in the corridor,
forced his way into the compartment, shoved the guard
headlong on the floor and grabbed me by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all right, old man?" he cried.  "For God's
sake, what have they done with you?"
</p>

<p>
I motioned to the key on the seat, and he fitted it
clumsily to the handcuffs.  Nikka and Watkins ran in
about this time; the guard regained his feet; the two
passengers returned; some more people tried to climb on
their shoulders to see what was going on; somebody else
fetched the police.
</p>

<p>
To the latter I told a hasty cock-and-bull story.
Bandits had assailed me, searched me for valuables which
luckily I did not possess, and left me as I was found.  I
described Toutou and his companion exactly as they had
appeared, sardonically convinced that they would be able
to take care of themselves against any detectives the
French provinces could boast; and the police, impressed
by Hugh's title and our assertion that we had an
important business engagement in Marseilles, placed no
obstacles in the way of our departure.
</p>

<p>
So the express steamed out of Lyons ten minutes late,
and Hugh and Nikka and Watkins escorted me back to
our own compartment.  And when I reached there, and
was safe from observation, I jangled the handcuffs before
their eyes and lay back and laughed until they thought I
was hysterical.
</p>

<p>
"It may have been funny for you," snapped Hugh.
"It certainly wasn't for us.  We were just getting ready
to unload at Lyons, convinced that you had been thrown
or fallen off the train."
</p>

<p>
"It's funny for all of us," I insisted, wiping the tears
from my eyes.  "It's a joke&mdash;on us.  Don't you see it,
Hugh?  You were claiming that we had shaken them
off, that we could sound the 'Stole Away.'  And then
they ransacked our baggage and kidnapped me on a
crowded train.  I tell you they are artists.  There never
was such a gang.  And as for Watty's pretty lady, she
is the greatest society villainness outside of the movies.
Didn't you feel like a cur when she stood there in the
door pulling her poor little undies together, with the hair
tumbled in her eyes?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll say I did," answered Hugh with feeling.  "That's
score for them again."
</p>

<p>
Nikka grinned at both of us.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be downhearted, you chaps.  The law of averages
works in these affairs as in everything.  And anyhow,
I've got a plan."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
WE SPLIT THE SCENT
</h3>

<p>
Nikka's plan was simple enough.
</p>

<p>
"When I was a boy and traveled with the
tribe," he said, "and we wished to cross a frontier
without being bothered by the Customs officers or the
Royal foresters, we divided into two parties and struck
off for our destination by two different routes."
</p>

<p>
Hugh nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I see.  You split the scent."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  Our trailers are experts, as I told you chaps
they would be.  If you will take my advice, you will
adopt Gypsy tactics against them.  Confuse them, string
out their pursuit&mdash;and then, perhaps, we can baffle them."
</p>

<p>
"I think you're right," answered Hugh.  "What do
you say, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Suits me," I agreed.  "Nikka obviously knows more
about this kind of game than we do."
</p>

<p>
"I've had experience," replied Nikka simply.  "Besides,
it's in my blood.  Ever since we embarked on this
expedition I have felt the old Gypsy strain in me
clamoring for the open road.  Toutou's gang are using
Gypsies.  Very well, let us use Gypsies."
</p>

<p>
"But how can we?" interrupted Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"My name still means something to my people," said
Nikka with that mediæval sang-froid which had amazed
me once before.  "My father's tribe will fight for me.
But in the first place, this is what I suggest.  Instead
of sailing for Constantinople by the Messageries Maritime
from Marseilles, let us take the train to Brindisi.
Our trailers will expect us either to sail on the
Messageries packet or else go by rail to Belgrade and
connect with the Orient Express for Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
"By going to Brindisi we shall surprise them, and
perhaps disarrange their plans.  Mind you, I don't expect
to throw them off; but they will be uncertain.  At
Brindisi we can connect with a boat for Piræus.  When we
board that boat they will begin to believe that they
understand our plans, because at Piræus one finds frequent
sailings for Constantinople.  And we shall book passage
from Piræus for Constantinople, as they expect.  But
after we have gone aboard with our baggage, Jack and I
will leave the boat by stealth."
</p>

<p>
"How are you going to manage all that?" I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"You can always bribe a steward," returned Nikka.
"It will be for Hugh and Watkins to keep the enemy's
attentions occupied.  They can engage in conversations
with us through the door of our stateroom, and that sort
of thing."
</p>

<p>
"But what then?" demanded Hugh.  "You divide
forces.  That makes each party half as strong as we are
now."
</p>

<p>
"There'll be no harm in that," Nikka reassured him.
"Our shadows will soon find out that Jack and I are not
on the Constantinople boat, and they won't venture to
touch you and Watkins until they have located us&mdash;which
I assure you they won't be able to do."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack and I are going to take another boat for Salonika,
and from Salonika we shall go by train to Seres in the
eastern tip of Greek Macedonia.  At Seres&mdash;and I don't
expect them to be able to trail us there&mdash;Jack and I will
disappear.  We shall cease to exist.  There will be two
additional members in the band of Wasso Mikali, my
mother's brother, and that band will be traveling to
Constantinople with horses from the Dobrudja to trade with
officers of the Allied detachments in the city."
</p>

<p>
"And Watty and I?" questioned Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"You go to the Pera Palace Hotel.  Meet this Miss
King and her father, but don't let anybody suspect that
you expected to meet them.  Remember, you will be
watched all the time.  Your rooms and your baggage will
be searched.  I think they will investigate the Kings, too.
Yes, that is likely.  You must have Miss King hide
the copy of the Instructions you sent her.  Not in
her trunks&mdash;ah, I have it!  Let her place it in an
envelope, addressed to herself, Poste restante.  She can
go to the Post Office and collect it whenever we need
it.
</p>

<p>
"You and Watkins will not be in any danger.  Toutou's
people will be too busy trying to find Jack and me.  They
will be suspecting that you are simply bait to distract
their attention&mdash;which will be quite correct.  But you
must be careful not to venture around the city without
plenty of company.  Take an Allied officer with you
whenever you can.  You might use the daylight hours to
find the site of the Bucoleon."
</p>

<p>
"Professor King can help them there," I interrupted.
"He knows old Constantinople quite well."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent," applauded Nikka.  "But remember,
Hugh, I said 'daylight hours.'  Don't venture around
indiscriminately, and don't go anywhere, even in the
daylight, without several other people.  The larger your
party, the safer you will be against accidents&mdash;and it is
an accident, rather than a deliberate attack, you will have
to guard against."
</p>

<p>
"But how are we going to get in touch with you?"
asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to us," replied Nikka, with his quiet grin.
"Make it a custom to lounge in front of the Pera Palace
every morning after breakfast for half an hour; and keep
a watch out for Gypsies.  You'll be seeing them all the
time, of course, but don't let on that you're interested
in them.  Some morning two especially disreputable
fellows will come by, and one of them will contrive to
get a word with you.  Follow them."
</p>

<p>
"That's a corking plan," Hugh approved warmly.
"Well, lads, we'll be in Marseilles early in the morning.
Shall we nap a bit?"
</p>

<p>
If we were followed in Marseilles, we didn't know it.
We only left the railroad station to get breakfast and
dispatch a telegram from Nikka to his uncle&mdash;or, rather, to
an address in Seres which acted as a clearing-house for
the operations of this particular Gypsy band.  Then we
took the train for Milan, and stopped off over-night to
secure some sleep.  The Italian railways were never very
comfortable, and the War did not improve them.
</p>

<p>
We figured, too, that by stopping at Milan we might
additionally confuse our shadows, as the city was a natural
point of departure for Belgrade.  But the first person I
saw in the Southern Express restaurant-car was Hélène
de Cespedes.  She had discarded her black dress for a
modish costume with furs, and sat by herself in dignified
seclusion, looking at once smartly aristocratic and
innocently lovely.  She greeted me with a smile, and
crooked her finger.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you 'ave nothing to do with 'er, Mister Jack,"
breathed Watkins explosively from the rear of our group.
"That's <i>'er</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Is that the pretty lady?" whispered Hugh.  "My
word, Watty, I'll forgive you!  Jack, you hound, introduce
us.  She looks better than she did the other night!"
</p>

<p>
I looked at Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good plan to know your enemies," he said.
"They already know us.  It can't do any harm for us
to know them."
</p>

<p>
Hélène gave us a charming smile.
</p>

<p>
"I'm delighted to meet you boys," she said.  "And
dear old Watkins!  We're quite friends, aren't we,
Watkins?"
</p>

<p>
Watkins mumbled something that I fear was scarcely
courteous.
</p>

<p>
"You can introduce me as the Countess de Cespedes, if
you like, Mr. Nash," she continued.  "I wonder if you
knew Cespedes, Mr. Zaranko?  He was a rotten old
duffer, but he took me off the stage."
</p>

<p>
"I've heard of him," said Nikka, smiling.  "Didn't he
leave you anything to keep you going?"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Other girls had the pickings before I met him.  There
was nothing left for me but the name."
</p>

<p>
"Is that the only one you use?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come, now," she remonstrated.  "There's a flag
of truce up.  Really, though, if you mention our
opposition, I ought to compliment you on your work so far.  I
believe you might elude any mob but ours."
</p>

<p>
"We'll leave the decision on that point to the future,"
smiled Nikka.  "By the way, how did you come to get
into this game?"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders again.  She was an odd
mixture of Latin grace and American ease.
</p>

<p>
"It's the sort of thing I do best.  My folks were Wops
of some kind.  I was born in New York.  I went with
crooks after I left school.  Then I joined the Follies, and
a broker cottoned to me.  He educated me, music, languages,
all that stuff.  I went to Paris with him.  When
we broke off, I tried the stage there.  It was just
before the War.  I was only a kid still, and Cespedes fell
for me.  After he croaked I tried a bit of everything.  For
a while I worked for the Austrians&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Spy?" questioned Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  There's no harm in mentioning it now, and
anyway, I was never caught.  That was how I happened to
meet Serge and Sandra; they were in Toutou's mob.  I
needed money; he needed brains and a doll-baby face."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have a grip on him," I said.  "But I
don't see how you can stand the beast.  He gives me the
creeps."
</p>

<p>
She eyed me curiously.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid of him," she answered indifferently.
"Most women are attracted by him, you know.  You
haven't seen his other side."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you don't," she agreed.  "Say, did you know
you made quite a hit with Sandra, Mr. Nash?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh and Nikka laughed.  I flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you needn't flare up," she said.  "I can see why
you did.  You boys are a good bunch of sports.  I wish
we didn't have to trim you."
</p>

<p>
"Why do it, then?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"I don't sell out," she answered curtly.  "Get that
straight, Lord Chesby.  Since I was a kid, I've had to
fight my own way.  As near as I can make out, the kind
of people who are called respectable and honest are only
cleverer crooks than the rest of us.  I'm out to make all
I can in my own way, and I play according to the rules
of my mob."
</p>

<p>
"You called us good sports," Nikka pointed out.
</p>

<p>
It was her turn to flush.
</p>

<p>
"Call it a woman's soft heart," she returned.  "Honestly,
I get fed up on this life once in a while.  If I could
have married a decent Wop back in New York, and had
a few kids and worked my fingers off&mdash;  Well, I wouldn't
have been able to get along without corsets and put it
over you the way I did in the Marseilles train the other
night, Lord Chesby."
</p>

<p>
"That may be true," Hugh agreed.  "You are the
first&mdash;ah&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Crook," she flashed, with a show of white teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for the word.  You are the first of your species
I've had the pleasure of meetin'.  I don't quite see the
attraction of the life for you."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't," she replied.  "I'm what you English
call a wrong 'un.  Maude Hilyer thinks that if she and
Montey could cash in they would chuck this life and go
straight.  But I know she's dead wrong.  If you're once
wrong, you're always wrong.  The best thing you can do
is to play safe and steer clear of the cops.  That's me."
</p>

<p>
"But I say!" Hugh objected.  "You say everybody is
crooked, and next you say&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what I say," she interrupted.  "You
aren't going to reform me.  And I'm against you.  And
if I can trim you I'll do it, and if Toutou wants to
knife you, and it won't interfere with the game, why, I'll
let him go ahead.  And with it all, I like you.  Now, do
you understand me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh, smiling.  "I once met a very gallant
Bavarian gentleman between two sets of barbed wire
to arrange about burying some dead soldiers, and we found
we liked each other very much.  But afterward we tried
hard to kill each other, and I am afraid I succeeded."
</p>

<p>
"You've got me," she assented.  "Well, you must be
hungry, boys.  You don't want to save a lot of trouble, and
maybe your lives, by giving up that treasure secret, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks, Countess," laughed Hugh.  "We'll give
you a bit of a run for your money yet."
</p>

<p>
She laughed back with that pleasant, well-bred trill of
a carefree schoolgirl, and we bowed and left her.
</p>

<p>
The next time we saw her she was standing by the
gangplank of the steamer at Brindisi.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you going on with us?" I hailed her.
</p>

<p>
"No, Mr. Nash.  I'm leaving you in competent hands.
Good lord, boy, you can't dodge us.  We've got a
system&mdash;well, the late well-known Czar might have been proud
to own it.  Be good, and give up before you get hurt."
</p>

<p>
"That goes for your people, too," I replied a trifle
grimly, for I was growing tired of threats.
</p>

<p>
She waved her hand impatiently, and stepped over to
my side.  Hugh and the others already were passing up
the gangplank.
</p>

<p>
"Say, boy, I don't want you to get hurt.  Neither does
Sandra.  If anything goes wrong, watch your step.  We'll
do what we can, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She pivotted on her heel and melted into the crowd.
I climbed the gangplank with my chin on my shoulder,
and was met with a shower of joshes by Hugh and Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Doin' a little missionary work?" inquired Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Do you flatter yourself you're aroused the lady's
disinterested affection?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"No, to both of you," I retorted.  "But she&mdash;what's
the words the novelists use?&mdash;oh, yes, she intrigues me."
</p>

<p>
"She'll intrigue you out of everything you know, if
you're not careful," Nikka warned me.
</p>

<p>
"Remember what she did to Watty," cautioned Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"The 'ussey!" grunted Watkins, who could never bear
to hear her mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Hugh predicted that we would yet meet her on board,
but a diligent search of the vessel failed to reveal anyone,
in or out of trousers, who remotely resembled her, and
we took account of several blonde northern peasants in
our canvass.  Also, whoever she had delegated to watch
us kept themselves severely in the background.  We were
not conscious of any espionage.
</p>

<p>
At Piræus we had a choice of several steamers sailing
for Constantinople, none of them Greek, however, as
Greece was at war with the Kemalist government which
had been set up in Anatolia.  Nikka pitched upon a French
boat that lay across the wharf from a Greek liner plying
to Salonika and the Greek islands of the Ægean.  The
Frenchman was sailing at dawn the next morning; the
Salonika boat was due to cast off several hours later.
</p>

<p>
We booked two cabins on the Frenchman, and hired a
clerk at the British consulate to reserve a cabin and
passage for two on the Salonika boat.  This arrangement
made, we mustered our scanty baggage, and boarded the
Frenchman just before dinnertime.  We dined together
ostentatiously in the saloon, having publicly concluded a
treaty with the purser that we might spend the night on
board and so avoid the inconvenience of an early
morning start.  And after dinner, with many yawns and
protestations of weariness, we betook ourselves to bed.
</p>

<p>
Our cabins were next to each other, and as a matter of
fact, we played poker until long past midnight.  Then
Nikka and I said good-by to Hugh and Watty, and sneaked
out into the companionway.  Several sleepy stewards
eyed us, but there were no passengers about.  The
quartermaster on guard at the gangway we handed a Napoleon,
telling him we were obliged to land in order to dispose
of some forgotten business.  The watchman on the pier
was conciliated in the same way.  And finally, the
deck-guard of the Greek liner, once his fingers were greased
and our tickets shown to him, offered no objection to
escorting us to our cabin.
</p>

<p>
At dawn we were awakened by the whistling of the
Frenchman as he backed out from the pier, and from a
porthole we watched him disappear in the mist of the
harbor.  At noon the <i>Epaminondas</i> likewise cast off, and
Nikka and I thankfully abandoned our battles with the
cockroaches that fought with us for possession of the
bunks, and ascended to the deck.
</p>

<p>
Nikka sniffed the air as we stepped from the saloon
companionway.
</p>

<p>
"It's good to be out of that stink below," I remarked
with feeling.
</p>

<p>
"I am trying to smell an enemy," he answered curtly.
</p>

<p>
"To smell&mdash;"  I hastily checked my temptation to ridicule
him, remembering that occasionally Nikka was startlingly
metamorphosed in to a creature of primordial
instincts.  "Oh," I said lamely, "and&mdash;er&mdash;do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he said seriously.  "It is as Hugh said.  We
have split the scent.  They are at fault."

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
THE BALKAN TRAIL
</h3>

<p>
At Salonika we entered a Europe which was new
to me, if an old story to Nikka, a Europe which
was blended with the life and color and form of
the Orient.  Tall minarets like fingers of doom pointed
skyward over bulbous domes, and driving to the railroad
station through blocks of shabby houses that had replaced
an area ravaged by fire, we heard the high-pitched,
wail-call of the muezzin.
</p>

<p>
Jews in long, black gaberdines; Albanian Arnauts, Tosks,
Ghegs and Malissori tribesmen, stately and savage; Greek
mountaineers in the dirty, starched fustenella; tall Serb
peasants, with the bearing of nobles and the faces of
poets; Bulgars, stolid, imperturbable and level-eyed;
hawk-nosed Ottoman Turks in tasseled fezzes; Armenians,
fawning and humble; lank, hungry Syrians; treacherous-looking
Greeks of the Peninsula; Greeks of the Islands,
beautiful as statues by Phidias; Roumanians, with heavy
black brows and the stocky build of Trajan's legionaries;
Tziganes, lean and gaudily dressed; Kurds with cruel eyes
and the bow-legs of a race of horsemen;&mdash;all the races of
the Near East swarmed and crowded and cursed and pushed
along the untidy sidewalks.
</p>

<p>
"This is No Man's Land," said Nikka as our dilapidated
automobile forced a slow progress through the
congested traffic.  "All races here hate one another.  We are
two hundred years behind western Europe.  Here treachery
is the rule.  Might is right.  The strong hand takes all.
Women are inferior beings&mdash;save amongst my own race."
</p>

<p>
His thin face lit with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Many things can be said against my people, but we
give our women freedom.  Yet over us, as over all the
other peoples, still hangs the shadow of Islam, shutting out
the sun, denying culture, restricting thought."
</p>

<p>
At the railroad station we fought for places in a
first-class compartment, which had room for six and must
accommodate eight.  The second and third-class cars were
jammed to the doors.  Women wept, children howled and
men swore and struck each other and their women
indiscriminately.  In the midst of it all, with one warning
whistle-blast, the train lunged out of the station, shaking
off superfluous passengers as it jolted over the switch on to
the main line.
</p>

<p>
That was a dreadful journey, not long as regards distance,
but tediously protracted in time.  The country grew
steadily more mountainous as we left the coast.  The
engine panted and heaved; the cars rattled and shook.  At
frequent intervals we stopped by some station, and the
scenes of our departure from Salonika were repeated
according to scale.  But the engine toiled on, and in the full
tide of hours we crawled over a mountain-ridge and saw
the sun rising in the east beyond the close-packed roofs
of Seres.
</p>

<p>
It was a town that seemed to huddle together as though
in fear, and there were great gashes and gaps in its lines
of white-washed house-walls, relics of three wars, each of
which had taken toll of its citizens.  Here and there a
church or a mosque, a school or a government building,
rose above the level of two-story dwellings.  But it had
none of the teeming squalor and gorgeous conflict of colors
that made Salonika so effective a gateway.
</p>

<p>
Nikka commandeered a fiacre in the station-square.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the house of Kostabidjian the moneylender?"
he asked the driver in Greek that sounded more
than passable to me.  "Very well, then, drive us there."
</p>

<p>
"Who is Kostabidjian?" I inquired as the driver
whipped up his small horses.
</p>

<p>
A dour, secretive look had settled on Nikka's face in the
last two days.  His eyes had narrowed, and their gaze was
fixed upon the far horizon when they were not shrewdly
surveying the appearances of people around him.
</p>

<p>
"He is the agent of the tribe," he replied shortly.  "It
was through him I sent word to my uncle."
</p>

<p>
I held my peace after that.  We drove for half an hour
into the northeastern suburbs, where the houses became
little villas, with courtyards and small gardens, and
sometimes orchards behind.  At last we stopped at a gateway
overhung by olive-trees, and the driver got down to pull
the bell-wire which protruded from an opening by the gate.
The solemn clangor echoed faintly, and was succeeded by
shuffling foot-steps.  A wicket opened, and a dark,
bewhiskered face was revealed.  Nikka ejaculated a single
sentence in the Gypsy dialect that Toutou's gang
sometimes used, and the gate swung ajar.  I gave the driver of
the fiacre a couple of drachmas, and followed Nikka inside.
</p>

<p>
The individual with the whiskers, a dried-up, elderly
man, quickly fastened the gate again, with a sidewise look
at Nikka, half respect, half fear.  The courtyard was
empty, save for some ponies and mules under a shed at
the rear, and the custodian motioned to us to follow him
to the house.
</p>

<p>
At the door, he stood aside and ushered us into a parlor
furnished in the French style.  Off it opened a dining-room.
A stout, smooth-faced, elderly man rose from a
desk as we entered.  He started to salaam, thought better
of it, and offered his hand, which Nikka grasped
perfunctorily.  Then he commenced to speak in the Tzigane
dialect, and Nikka cut him off.
</p>

<p>
"Speak French," said Nikka curtly.  "I have no secrets
from my friend, Mr. Nash."  And to me: "This is Monsieur
Kostabidjian."
</p>

<p>
Kostabidjian bowed to me.
</p>

<p>
"My poor home is honored, indeed, by two such
distinguished guests," he protested.  "Monsieur Zaranko, it
is many years now since I had the pleasure of meeting you,
but you will find that I have executed all your commissions
faithfully."
</p>

<p>
Nikka smiled sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"You would not be alive and whole if you had not,"
he commented.
</p>

<p>
"Surely, you do not mean that you think I would do
anything else," cried Kostabidjian.
</p>

<p>
"I mean I am sure that you do as I command," returned
Nikka impatiently.  "Also, that I feel I do not have
to rely upon your honesty in the matter.  Now, what news
have you for me?"
</p>

<p>
Kostabidjian&mdash;he was an Armenian of uncertain parentage,
I afterwards discovered, with the ingrained servility
pounded into that unfortunate race by centuries of
oppression&mdash;drew up chairs for us.
</p>

<p>
"The telegram was forwarded at once to the Chief," he
answered.  "But Wasso Mikali sent back word yesterday
that he would be delayed in waiting upon you in
consequence of a caravan of cartridges which the band are
running into Albania.  It is an affair which has attracted
his attention for the past month, and he dares not trust the
work to another."
</p>

<p>
"Does he, himself, go to Albania?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Monsieur Zaranko.  But the starting of the
caravan, and the paying of the purchase-price&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In advance?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"Good," said Nikka.  "When will he be here?"
</p>

<p>
"He spoke of to-morrow&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then serve us food, and lead us to a room where we
may rest."
</p>

<p>
The Armenian clapped his hands, and the old man with
the whiskers&mdash;who was dumb in consequence of having
had his tongue cut out in one of the Turkish massacres of
the red past&mdash;returned and carried word in his own fashion
of our wants to the kitchen.  Presently we sat down in the
dining room to a hot meal of pilaf, with chicken, dough
cakes and coffee, which Kostabidjian pressed upon us
officiously.
</p>

<p>
"It has been a hard year for the tribe, Monsieur
Zaranko," he purred, rubbing his hands together.  "I
don't know what they would have done without your aid."
</p>

<p>
"The subject is not for discussion," rapped Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ah!  Certainly!"
</p>

<p>
And he was quiet for a few minutes.  Then his loquacity
gained the better of him, and he burst forth:
</p>

<p>
"It's not as it used to be in the Balkans, gentlemen!
The law doesn't run any stronger.  I'll say that.  And
boundaries are still vague, for all that the great ones in
Paris decided.  But people are poor as Hajji Achmet after
he'd been to Mecca.  They earn nothing, and have nothing&mdash;and
therefore there's nothing to take or to steal.  Hee-hee-hee!"
</p>

<p>
"You talk nonsense," said Nikka savagely.  "Am I to
be annoyed by such as you?"
</p>

<p>
No prince could have been more arrogant; no lackey
could have succumbed more completely.
</p>

<p>
"P-p-par-d-dd-don!"  The Armenian's teeth rattled.
</p>

<p>
"You may go.  I will summon you if I have need."
</p>

<p>
The man went like a whipped dog, and cowered over
his mysterious accounts at the desk in the next room.
</p>

<p>
Nikka sat through the meal with a black frown on his
face.  He was plainly out of sorts, and while I could
understand his aversion to Kostabidjian, I was secretly
amazed by the constantly growing change in his manner,
for he was normally of a uniformly pleasant disposition.
But it was not until we had been shown to a bedroom on
the upper floor that he unmasked his feelings.  I began to
undress, but he paced the floor restlessly from wall to
wall.  Suddenly he turned on me:
</p>

<p>
"Jack, I hope I haven't insulted you in the past
twenty-four hours."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not aware of it, if you have," I returned cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"I'm having a hell of a time," he groaned.  "The two
selfs in me are wrenching at my soul.  There's Nikka, the
Gypsy freebooter, who has been dead for years, and against
him fights Nikka, the artist and man of the town.  Neither
of them owns me.  Until the other day&mdash;except now and
then when the old self reared its head temporarily&mdash;I
thought I had thrust the Gypsy behind me.  But I was a
fool to think so, Jack.  God, what a fool!  Why, the music
in me always was Gypsy!
</p>

<p>
"But I thought I had submerged it, drowned it.  I
thought I was like you and Hugh.  I know better now.
Since we started east I have felt these half-dead instincts
rising up in me, clutching at my soul, tormenting my
intelligence.  The hunger for the open road, contempt for
order and law, the mastery of my own will, all these
things call to me.  And yet, Jack, I feel ashamed!  I feel
ashamed to bring you here, to have you meet the fellow
downstairs, who, when all is said and done, is the agent
through whom my people dispose of what they steal and
smuggle.
</p>

<p>
"For that's the truth, Jack!  My people are not like
Toutou's gang.  But they are Gypsies.  They live by their
own hands, and every man's hand is against them.  They
make their own laws, and abide by their own customs.
They take what they need, and consider it their due.
Kostabidjian spoke of my uncle's running cartridges to
Albania.  I know what it means.  After the War there
were vast stocks of ammunition scattered all over the
Balkans, treasure trove to such wild peoples.  The Allies
ruled that it should be surrendered or destroyed.  But do
you suppose it was?  Never!
</p>

<p>
"It was stolen, hidden and smuggled.  I would swear
that my tribe have sold it to Kemal Bey, to the Russian
Soviets.  Now, the Greeks and the Serbs are pressing down
on the Albanians, and my uncle sells to the Albanians.
If he can, too, he will sell to the Greeks and the Serbs;
and he will take&mdash;steal, if you like&mdash;whatever of value he
can get from all three of them.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you all this, because I don't want to fly false
colors with you.  I lived that life when I was a boy.  But
I should like to make you understand that in some way,
by some esoteric, involved, well-nigh impenetrable process
of psychology, it is not stealing in the sense that Toutou
steals.  My people have been outcasts for centuries; they
have been bred up in this way of life.  It is as natural
for them to take what they need, and thrive on other
people's needs, as it is for the Arabs to practice the same
methods in battling the hardships of the desert.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't wrong in their eyes.  Put it that way.  And
I&mdash;I can see it both ways, Jack.  I can see how wrong it
is, and I can see how right it seems to them."
</p>

<p>
I dropped my hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You don't need to say all this to me," I told him.
"Why, Nikka, it's&mdash;it's&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's what?  Hard to understand!"
</p>

<p>
"Easy to understand," I corrected.  "Hard to phrase.
But I know you too well to worry about you.  As for the
wrench, I'm beginning to feel it myself."
</p>

<p>
Nikka resumed his restless pacing.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind anything so much as that oily Armenian
downstairs," he insisted.  "He&mdash;he is dishonest.  And we
make him dishonest.  Not that I've used him so, Jack.
Most of what I earn goes to my people, who need it, poor
souls, especially since the War laid its blight on all
south-eastern Europe.  Kostabidjian is one of the agents I
employ to distribute my funds.  I use him because of his
connection with my uncle's tribe."
</p>

<p>
"Most of us have to use dishonest helpers occasionally,"
I said.  "I'd hate to have to guarantee every business
associate of mine.  But can we trust this man, Nikka?  If
he's all you indicate him, isn't he likely to sell us out?"
</p>

<p>
"He'd sell us out in a minute, if he dared," rejoined
Nikka, with a tight-lipped smile.  "But he knows that
if he did he would get a knife in him.  It would be only
a question of time."
</p>

<p>
"Nice company you've dragged me into," I grumbled.
"Well, let's catch up on our sleep."
</p>

<p>
His outburst had eased Nikka's nervous tension, and he
soon dozed off.  For a while I watched the afternoon
sunlight outside the windows, then the weariness of our
travels overcame me, and I, too, slept....  I woke
abruptly, feeling a light blazing in my eyes.  My first
thought was of Toutou and Hélène de Cespedes, and I
dived under the pillow for my automatic and sat up at the
same time.
</p>

<p>
A man was standing in the doorway of the room, with a
kerosene lamp in his hand, a tall man, with the proud face
of an eagle.  Wisps of silver-white hair escaped from the
varicolored turban that wrapped his brows, but he held
himself with the erect poise of youth.  He was dressed
in tight breeches of brown cloth, and a blue shirt and short
red jacket.  Flat sandals of bull's-hide, sewed to a point
at the toes, were laced over his bare feet by straps that
wound across his insteps and above his ankles.  Around
his waist was twisted a heavy sash, bristling with knives
and pistols.
</p>

<p>
As I prodded Nikka awake, he closed the door behind
him and set the lamp on a table, calmly ignoring my pistol.
Nikka, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, took one look at
the apparition and jumped from the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Wasso!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
The stranger raised fingers to lips and breast in a
graceful salaam, and replied in the Gypsy patois, a cadenced,
musical speech when used by those to whom it was a
mother-tongue.  Nikka grasped his hand, and exchanged a
rapid-fire of question and answer, then called to me:
</p>

<p>
"This is my uncle.  He arrived sooner than he expected.
He guessed my need was great, and traveled without
respite.  Come and meet him."
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali rendered me a salaam and a handshake.
His bright eyes surveyed my face, and he made a comment
which drew a laugh from Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"My uncle thinks you have the look of one who likes
to know how many cartridges his enemy carries," Nikka
translated.
</p>

<p>
The old Gypsy sank to his haunches on the bare floor,
with a sweeping gesture of invitation to both of us to join
him.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," exclaimed Nikka as I started for a chair.
"He has never sat on a chair in his life.  Do as he does
or he will think you are trying to demonstrate how
different you are."
</p>

<p>
So I crouched cross-legged beside them&mdash;it seemed to be
easy enough for Nikka to resume the ways of his
boyhood&mdash;and concealed my discomfort as stoically as I could.
It was close to midnight when we were awakened, and
the talk with Wasso Mikali lasted for several hours.  First,
Nikka explained to him the circumstances of our trip
to Constantinople, and the old man's eyes glistened at the
mention of the treasure.  He interrupted with a liquid
flow of polysyllables.
</p>

<p>
"He says," Nikka interpreted, when he had finished,
"that he has heard about it.  It is just as I told you and
Hugh, the tradition is known all through the Balkans.  He
says that the treasure is concealed in an ancient palace in
Stamboul which has been inhabited longer than men can
remember by a tribe of Gypsies whose chief is one Beran
Tokalji.  He says that this Tokalji is a great thief&mdash;"  Nikka
grinned ruefully&mdash;"that comes well from my uncle,
Jack, and that there is a rumor amongst the tribes that
he, Tokalji, is an ally of a group of Frank thieves.  There
is a tradition in Tokalji's tribe that their forefathers
believed the treasure ultimately would go to them."
</p>

<p>
"Will he help us?" I asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Nikka gave me an odd look.
</p>

<p>
"His tribe are mine.  My wish is their wish.  How can
they refuse?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I insisted, "but how much will they want?  Is
it safe to tell him all this?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka's face flushed purple.  For a moment I thought
he would strike me.  Then he turned, and shot a question
at the old Gypsy, who replied with an amused grin.
</p>

<p>
"I did not repeat your second question," said Nikka
coldly.  "He would not have taken it in good grace even
from me.  But I did tell him your first.  Do you want to
know just what his answer was?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "and I say, Nikka, don't be uppish
because I don't know the ropes about your damned family.
Man dear, this is all new to me!"
</p>

<p>
Nikka relented at once.
</p>

<p>
"My fault," he apologized, slightly shamefaced.  "This
Gypsy complex I told you about plays funny tricks with
me.  But&mdash;" and his grin duplicated Wasso Mikali's&mdash;"My
uncle's precise answer to your first question was that
he would consider 'the spittle of his sister's son ample
payment for whatever he could do.'  He meant it, too."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
THE ROAD TO STAMBOUL
</h3>

<p>
Wasso Mikali was a very wise man.  He
questioned Nikka closely concerning our
situation, and this was his verdict:
</p>

<p>
"When you fight with thieves you must use thieves'
tricks.  You did right to come to me.  Now I will secure
fitting garments for you, my sister's son, and for your
Amerikansky friend, Jakka.  For him also I will brew a
dye of walnut bark and chestnut leaves that will make him
as dark as our people, so that men will not turn and stare
at him on the road.
</p>

<p>
"After that I think we had best go away from this
place as soon as possible.  You have traveled rapidly and
shaken off your enemies' pursuit.  It is well to take every
advantage of an opportunity.  Moreover, we must go
across the Rhodopes to the place where the tribe have
hidden some horses we got from a Roumanian boyar.  We
will collect the horses, together with some of my young
men who can handle a knife, and go on to Stamboul.  All
men go to Stamboul, and who will notice a Tzigane band?"
</p>

<p>
"But it was not my thought that you should abandon the
affairs of the tribe, and come and fight with me,"
remonstrated Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Are you not the son of my sister?" rejoined the old
Gypsy.  "If you had not elected to go to Buda with your
violin would you not be chief of the band?  Do I not
stand in your place?  Well, then, light of my eyes, we
will do for you all that we may."
</p>

<p>
And he produced a battered silver tobacco box, and
rolled himself a cigarette, sitting back on his haunches with
the lithe grace of a cat.  Nikka flung me a proud glance
as he translated the pledge.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," I admitted with due humility.  "And
I was all wrong, but I didn't know the Middle Ages were
still with us."
</p>

<p>
Nikka laughingly repeated my remark, and his uncle's
twinkling eyes and mocking smile conveyed his retort
before it was translated:
</p>

<p>
"Say to my young friend Jakka that if a tribe cannot
stand by their own then these days are worse than the
old times."
</p>

<p>
With that he left us, and Nikka and I secured another
hour's sleep.  When he returned he was accompanied by
a younger edition of himself, who carried two bundles
which were disclosed as complete suits of Tzigane dress.
He, himself, carried a pot of warm, brown liquid, and he
proceeded to apply the stain to me with a small paintbrush.
Hair, mustache, face and body were darkened to
a mellow brown.  The stuff dried quickly, and I was soon
able to pull on the strange garments, which Nikka showed
me how to adjust and fasten.
</p>

<p>
I could not help laughing at my reflection in the mirror
of the cheap French bureau de toilette.  The tight trousers,
the short jacket and the big turban increased my height,
and the gaudy colors of turban and waist-sash gave me
a bizarre appearance that was startlingly unfamiliar.  I
felt uncomfortable, as though I had dressed for a
fancy-dress ball, and overdone the part.  But there was none
of this effect in Nikka's get-up.  With the donning of
his Gypsy costume he discarded his last visible link with
the West.  He looked the Gypsy, the Oriental, a kingly
vagabond.
</p>

<p>
"You belong," I said.  "But I feel like an imposter."
</p>

<p>
"You'll grow used to it," he answered, folding in the
ends of his sash.  "Did they give you a knife?"  I
exhibited the horn-handled, eight-inch blade, with its sheath
hooked to a leather belt that encircled my waist beneath
the sash.  "Good!  Got your automatic and spare clips?"
</p>

<p>
"And these clothes?"
</p>

<p>
I pointed to the civilized garments we had discarded.
</p>

<p>
"Kostabidjian will send them on to Constantinople in
a few days."  He sighed.  "Personally, Jack, I don't care
if I never wear them again.  I can earn a thousand dollars
an hour with my fiddle, but what's it worth compared
with this?  Rawhide on your feet that flexes with your
soles; clothing that covers you, but doesn't bind; and
the open road ahead!  Civilization is a fraud, Jack.  I
was a fool ever to quit the Gypsy life.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're back in it again," I replied, "and perhaps
you'll be feeling you were a fool to return to it.  I
know I feel like a fool.  Let's go."
</p>

<p>
It was still dark when we left the house.  Kostabidjian
and his servant were awaiting us in the courtyard.  They
had saddled two horses, and a mule was loaded with bulky
packs, food, and blankets, tarpaulins and several cooking
utensils.  The Armenian kept himself in the background.
He seemed in deadly fear of Wasso Mikali, who treated
him as though he was a cur to be kicked into the gutter
if he interfered.  And indeed, there was something
singularly imposing about the old Tzigane, who strode around
with the air of one used to taking as he desired and giving
as he pleased.
</p>

<p>
But just as we were leaving, the dumb servant having
swung open the outer door, Kostabidjian mustered
sufficient courage to press to Nikka's side.
</p>

<p>
"Everything was satisfactory?" he inquired timidly.
"I have served&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well enough," returned Nikka, swinging into the saddle
of one of the horses, "except that you talk too much.
Guard your tongue if you would keep it.  Your servant
there&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged significantly.  Even by the starlight I
could see the pallor that blanched the Armenian's face.
He took the threat in sober earnest.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have no cause to blame!  All shall be as
you wish.  I will remit the charges for the last distribution.
Take your horse, Monseigneur, both horses&mdash;the
mule!  Take all!"
</p>

<p>
Nikka gave him a single look, and he subsided.
</p>

<p>
"Heidi, Jakka!" called Wasso Mikali.
</p>

<p>
"Mount, Jack," added Nikka.  "The other horse is for
you.  We must hasten.  My uncle does not like to be seen
entering or leaving the town."
</p>

<p>
We rode out in single-file, first Wasso Mikali, then Nikka,
then myself, last the young Tzigane, leading the pack-mule.
The Gypsies set a pace that made the horses trot to
keep up with them, a long, slack-kneed shamble, ungainly
in appearance, but tremendously effective.  By sunrise we
had left the town behind the first mountain-ridge, and were
heading north towards the waste of mountains that fringed
the Bulgarian frontier.  Hour after hour we plodded
along.  More than once I suggested a rest, for I knew
our escorts had been afoot all night.  But they would not
hear of it.  Neither would they consent to sharing the
horses with us turn-about, and in this Nikka upheld them.
</p>

<p>
"Our feet are soft," he pointed out.  "We could never
maintain such a speed, and it is best to put as long a
distance as possible between us and Seres, lest our trailers
should pick up the scent."
</p>

<p>
During the early part of the day we passed frequent
villages, melancholy collections of hovels that had been
scorched by the awful visitation of wars the Balkans had
known for a decade.  But in the afternoon we departed
from the main road, and struck off across the hills.
Occasionally we saw farmhouses or sheepfolds, but when
night came we made camp in a lonely ravine with the stars
for roof.  There was not a light on the horizon, not even
the barking of dogs to indicate a human habitation.
</p>

<p>
The next day it was practically the same.  The trail
we followed was a mere trace that sometimes disappeared.
Toward evening we entered a vast forest, and finally halted
on the banks of a stream where a campfire blazed.  Against
the flames showed gaunt, turbanned figures.
</p>

<p>
"Are these our friends?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"They are Pomaks," said Nikka.
</p>

<p>
He spat contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Moslems!  Swine!"
</p>

<p>
While Wasso Mikali and the young Tzigane, whose
name was Sacha, made the fire under a bowlder, Nikka and
I led our tired animals down to the stream to drink.
Several of the Pomaks, dirty, shifty-eyed fellows in the
same gaudy raiment that the Tziganes affected, lounged up
to us.  One of them stepped in Nikka's path, and Nikka
promptly kicked him.  The man turned like a flash, his
knife out, and Nikka dropped the bridle he was holding,
and closed with him.  Two of the Pomaks jumped for me,
knives wheeling.
</p>

<p>
I did what I had done in the fight in the Gunroom, hit
out with my fists.  The first man I knocked into the water,
and the second yelled for help, circling me cautiously the
while.  Nikka, after one click of blades, stabbed his man
in the shoulder, and we stood back to back, half a dozen
Pomaks pelting up from their fire.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," said Nikka, as I drew my automatic.
</p>

<p>
There was a scurry in the shadows, and Wasso Mikali
thrust his way into the group surrounding us.  He said
nothing, but stood there where they could see him in the
firelight, and they muttered together and slunk away, the
man Nikka had wounded clutching his bloody arm.
</p>

<p>
"What is your uncle?  A justice of the peace?" I
inquired facetiously.
</p>

<p>
"He is Wasso Mikali," answered Nikka, wiping his
knife-blade on the grass.  "Now I feel better, Jack.  It
is still the same.  The Pomak curs crawl to heel when the
Gypsy speaks.  I wondered if it could be just as in my
boyhood, after all that has happened in the world."
</p>

<p>
"If you ask me," I returned, "I don't believe anything
has happened in this world of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Much has happened.  But the Gypsy is always the
same&mdash;and so likewise, it seems, is the Pomak.  God, but
it felt good to kick that pig!"
</p>

<p>
I regarded my friend with a recurrence of that
amazement which he had stirred in me several times before.
The quiet, self-contained musician, the artist, the efficient
subaltern of the Foreign Legion, the cultured man-about-town
had been replaced by an arrogant forest princeling,
savagely contemptuous of all but his own kind.
</p>

<p>
The Pomaks gave us a wide birth, and early as we were
afoot in the morning, they were off before us; but we heard
from them again.  We were threading a forest defile,
where the pine-trees grew thick to the cliff edges, when
we heard a shout overhead, I looked up at a stocky man in
a brown uniform, with a round fur cap, emblazoned with
a rampant lion.  He held a rifle in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"A Bulgarian forester," muttered Nikka.
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali climbed up to the forester's perch, and
held a brief conversation with him, at the conclusion of
which he dug something bright out of his sash and dropped
it in the forester's hand.  Then he slid down into the
ravine again, and we resumed our journey.  The Pomaks
had complained to the forester that we were smuggling
rose-water essence, but he readily admitted that we were
going the wrong way to be handling such a traffic.  The
lefa piece in his hand was to salve his conscience for not
reporting the stabbing of the Pomak by Nikka.
</p>

<p>
As we progressed that day the mountains became wilder
and more barren.  Once we saw a lumber-camp on the
lower slope of a ridge we traversed.  Again, in the early
afternoon, I saw what I took to be a castle perched atop
of a huge crag miles away across a tumbled mass of
peaks.  But Nikka explained that it was one of those
fortified monasteries which kept the fires of learning alight
during the gloomy centuries when the Turk's rule ran as
far as the Danube.
</p>

<p>
The path we followed was eccentric in the extreme.  In
fact, there was no path.  We climbed a succession of
gullies and ravines opening out of one another, and at dusk
emerged upon a sheltered valley, buried deep between
precipitous slopes draped in a virgin covering of conifers,
chestnut and beech.  A little rivulet foamed down the
middle, dammed at the foot by a crude barrier of rocks.
Horses and mules and a few sheep and goats grazed on
the banks.  Against the mountain-wall on either side were
built a number of rough log-shelters, part houses, part
caves.  Children, naked for the most part, played about.
Women were washing in the brook or tending several open
fires.  A dozen men were lying or sitting on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"They don't seem surprised to see us," I commented to
Nikka, whose brooding eyes were drinking in the picture.
</p>

<p>
"They know we must be friends," he answered.  "Else
the lookouts down the path would have signaled them we
were coming&mdash;and we should not have come," he added
with a flitting smile.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know this place?"
</p>

<p>
"As well as&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;As well as Hugh
knows Castle Chesby.  No, I was not born here.  My
mother lay on the floor-boards of a caravan-cart in the
Bukowina.  My father was looking for likely ponies to
trade with Bulgarian officers.  But they brought me back
here, and here I grew to boyhood.  Do you see that first
hovel on this bank?  That was where I was taught to
fiddle.  And there&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali, striding in front of us, raised his voice
in a great shout, and the men by the houses jumped to
their feet and crowded toward us.  The old Gypsy added
something in which Nikka's name was repeated two or
three times, and they cried out in astonishment.  In the
next moment they were swarming around us, and sinewy
hands were clasping ours, rows of white teeth were
gleaming in welcoming smiles, and Nikka was being greeted with
a heart-warming mixture of affection and respect.
</p>

<p>
Once they discovered I could not talk their language
they let me alone, but Nikka they plied with questions
until the women summoned us to the fires for the evening meal.
Their attitude toward him was extraordinary.  He was one
of themselves&mdash;several were his cousins, most of them were
related to him in some remote degree of consanguinity; he
had lived amongst them for years.  Yet to them, as to
the rest of the world, he was also the great master, the
violinist who could charm multitudes, upon whose bounty,
too, they and others like them had been sustained in
periods of want.
</p>

<p>
While the women served us with stew and bread, Nikka
introduced me to them, and they promptly manifested a
naïve interest in my person and career.  They all called
me Jakka.  They were amazed to learn that I made my
living by drawing plans of houses for people.  Who, they
inquired with frank disbelief, needed to have somebody
draw for him the plan of his house?  It was absurd.
You simply took logs and boards or bricks and stone, if
you were in a city, and you put them together.  They even
insisted upon dragging me away from the fire to the
nearest house to illustrate what they meant.  They were
determined to convince me how superfluous was my profession.
</p>

<p>
I, in my turn, was surprised by the idyllic security of
this retired valley, and I asked them, through Nikka, if it
had never been penetrated even in wartime.  No, they
replied, only once a party of Franks in pot-hats&mdash;by which,
it seemed, they meant Germans&mdash;had come upon it by
accident, and of the Franks not one had escaped.  Of
course, occasional attempts had been made to drive them
out by other outlaw bands; but none had ever succeeded,
in consequence of the vigilance of their watch and the
tortuous approach through a network of defiles.
</p>

<p>
Their community persisted in defiance of civilization, an
anomalous relic of the stone age, of nomad barbarism;
and they assured me that here and there all over the
Balkans other similar Gypsy communities still held out, in
spite of the havoc of destruction wrought by the War.
</p>

<p>
We remained in the valley for one day, just long enough
for Wasso Mikali to pick the six men he intended to take
with him, select horseflesh for ostensible trading purposes,
and made the necessary arrangements for leaving the tribe
so long without his guidance.  It interested me that he
appointed as sub-chief his wife, a wrinkled old beldame, who
boasted a complete mouthful of yellowed teeth and rolled
cigarettes with one hand.  And it was significant of the
conditions under which they lived that we stole away by
twilight, so that our exit might not be observed by chance
spies of rival bands, who would thus learn of the reduction
of their garrison.
</p>

<p>
Two days' journey to the east carried us into the colorful
stream of traffic on a main-traveled highway.  Caravans
of pack-ponies jingled along.  Bands of itinerant
Gypsies like ourselves; camel trains, endless processions
of ox-carts, and very rarely, an automobile or a fiacre,
moved in both direction.  Monks from the mountain
monasteries looked askance at Pomak and Tzigane.  The
Balkan races in their varied garb jangled and wrangled by.
But not too close to the Greek frontier we swerved into
a byway, and gave the custom houses a safe margin.
</p>

<p>
After that it was the same story for more than a week.
True, when we abandoned the mountains and dipped into
the rolling plains of Thrace, we left behind us the
trappings of barbarism.  But the air we breathed and the
scenes that unrolled before us belonged to the Orient.
We had occasional minor adventures, fights with keepers
of roadside khans, disputes with other parties and attempts
to steal our horses.  But Wasso Mikali was a prince of
the road.  He met stealth with guile, force with nerve.
He was never defeated.
</p>

<p>
Two hundred and fifty miles we traveled, south and
east, and at last there came a day when we passed the
Tchataldya barrier, and from a hillock caught a glimpse
of a skyline of towers and floating domes and soaring
minarets and beyond them to the right a hint of blue that
was the meeting-place of the Bosphorus and the Marmora.
</p>

<p>
"It looks like a fairy city!" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"It will stink in your nostrils," replied Nikka curtly.
"It is Stamboul&mdash;the last stand of the Turk."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
THE HOUSE IN SOKAKI MASYERI
</h3>

<p>
Until we crossed its very threshold the spell of
the city held us.  Not even the noisome belt
of Russian refugee camps and tawdry villas and
the unkempt tombs of the Hills of the Dead could shatter
the illusion of that splendid skyline.  The nearer we
approached, the more impressive it became.  The long gray
line of the old Byzantine walls, the uneven lift of the
roofs staggering up and down its seven hills, the swelling
domes of mosque and basilica, the slender beauty of countless
minarets, the faultless contour of cypress groves and
the far blue gleam of the Golden Horn and the Marmora,
with the dim background of the Asiatic hills, all combined
to mold a picture of piercing loveliness.
</p>

<p>
But when we passed through the echoing arch of the
Adrianople Gate the spell was broken.  Crazy houses
toppled over the filth of the streets; a dense mass of
unwashed humans eddied to and fro; squalor beggaring
description leered from the steep lanes and alleys that
branched off from the main streets.  A hundred races
swarmed about us, vying with one another in wretchedness
and misery.  Dogs and flies fought in the gutters with
children and old people.  Beggars whined for baksheesh.
Food venders yelled their cries and hawked their unsanitary
wares.  Every kind of clothing appeared, from greasy
European dress to the quaint peasant costumes of
south-eastern Europe and Anatolia and all the countries
eastwards to the Hindoo Koosh.
</p>

<p>
It was like one's fancies of the Arabian Nights, and yet
unlike them.  For here was no lavishness of Oriental
display, no exotic magnificence, only suffering and want and
hunger and disease and smells and a dreadful ugliness
that was spiritual as well as physical.  It was as if a
gigantic, cancerous sore, festering and gangrened through
the centuries, had eaten away the vitality of what had once
been the richest city in the world.  And back and forth in
that swarm of humanity's dregs wandered men of the
civilization which had prospered outside the pale of Islam,
French and British officers, bluejackets, poilus, tommies
and an occasional tourist, clinging to a smirking guide.
</p>

<p>
Nikka, riding beside me, viewed the spectacle with
cynical detachment.
</p>

<p>
"Seven hundred years ago," he said, "this was incomparably
the stateliest, most powerful city in Christendom.
It was the center of an Empire that was still able to stand
alone, although it had borne the burden of resisting the
Moslem attacks on the Western world for more than five
hundred years.  It enshrined all that was best and most
worthy of the ancient Greek and Roman culture.  It had
a million inhabitants.  It had public services, schools, posts,
police, drains, water supply.  Life was safe, commercial
independence and prosperity assured&mdash;which was more than
could be said for any other community, East or West."
</p>

<p>
"And the Turks made it what it is!" I exclaimed, as
Wasso Mikali, leading our little procession, turned off the
main street we had been following into one of the
stinking, littered lanes that twisted down into shadowy
regions of corruption.
</p>

<p>
"Not the Turks!  The Turks only finished what others
had begun.  No, the beginning of what you see around
you was made by Hugh's ancestor and his brother knights
of the Fourth Crusade, who, instead of fulfilling their
vows to journey to the Holy Land, voyaged to Constantinople
and overpowered the feeble Emperor of that day,
and then sacked and wrecked the city.  It was never the
same afterward.  It never recovered its strength.  And
when the Crusades finally impelled the concentration of
the Moslem power, it became only a question of time before
the city must fall.  Had it not been for those walls we
just passed, it would have fallen a century before it did.
In fact, it fell then mainly because there were not enough
men to hold the defenses."
</p>

<p>
"What you say is interesting," I said.  "For after all,
we are coming to-day on Hugh's behalf for pretty much
the same object as lured his ancestor.  We are hunting
the treasure of the city."
</p>

<p>
"But we shall do no harm to any one by taking the
treasure," returned Nikka.  "What use would it be to
these people around us?  Would they share it?  Never!
It would be employed for the pleasures of their masters.
The only way to redeem Constantinople is to repopulate."
</p>

<p>
We plunged deeper and deeper into the dark byways,
sometimes traversing streets so narrow that pedestrians
were compelled to squeeze themselves flat against the house-walls
to permit us to pass.  In the twilight it was difficult
to see far ahead, and at every corner Wasso Mikali raised
his voice in a shout of warning.  But at last we rode forth
into a wider thoroughfare and stopped opposite the gate
of a huge, fortress-like building, whose windowless stone
walls towered above the surrounding housetops.
</p>

<p>
"The Khan of the Georgians," explained Nikka.  "Here
we shall be swallowed up in an army of travelers.  No
one would think of looking for us in such a place."
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali made the necessary payment to the porter
at the gate, and we rode between the ponderous,
steel-bound doors into a courtyard such as you find in a
barracks.  Around it rose three tiers of galleries, arched in
stone, and below them were a succession of stables fronted
by sheds and penthouses.  Piles of goods lay everywhere,
in the courtyard and on the galleries.  Horses, mules, oxen
and camels neighed, brayed, bellowed and grunted.  Men
talked in knots on the mucky cobbles of the court, squatted
in every gallery or leaned over the railings shouting to
each other.  Women sat on bales and nursed their infants.
Children ran about with the usual ability of children to
escape sudden death in dangerous places.  It sounded like
a boiler factory and an insane asylum holding a jubilee
convention.
</p>

<p>
But Wasso Mikali and his young men pushed through the
confusion with the same bored air I would have worn in
bucking the subway rush, at Grand Central.  They
appropriated a corner of a stable, and put up the horses,
uncinched the packs and climbed a flight of stone stairs to
the second floor, where the old Gypsy rented two cubicles,
each lighted by a grated window two feet square and
containing nothing except some foul straw, from a custodian
who looked like the conception of Noah entertained by the
artists of the subscription editions of the Holy Bible.
</p>

<p>
Nikka had relapsed so thoroughly to Gypsyism that he
professed not to be suspicious of the straw, but at my
insistance he procured a worn broom from Father Noah and
we swept out the room which had been set aside for Wasso
Mikali and ourselves.  The six retainers in Wasso's train
were given the next cubicle, and they promptly piled into
it the straw which we had banished from our room, so
I doubt whether our labors produced any benefit, as they
spent as much time with us as in their own quarters.
</p>

<p>
Such food as we did not have with us we bought from
a general store conducted in an angle of the courtyard,
and the cooking was done over a brazier, which, with the
necessary charcoal, we rented from Father Noah.  When
night fell, and the cooking fires blazed out all over the
courtyard and in the galleries it was a sight worth coming
to Constantinople to see.  There was an acrid reek of dung
in the air, the sweaty smell of human bodies, the pungent
aroma of the charcoal, and an endless babble of voices in
a score of tongues and dialects.
</p>

<p>
Afterward some men on our gallery played on bagpipes.
From the courtyard came the twanging of simple stringed
instruments, and nasal voices lifted in interminable
melancholy songs.  A woman who was no better than she
should have been danced in the light of two flaring
kerosene torches by the gate until she won the attention of a
bandy-legged Turcoman rug-merchant.  A thief attempted
to pick the purse of a fat Persian.  A Kurdish horse-dealer
tried to knife a snarling Greek.  And gradually the
khan's inmates sought their sleep.  Most of them lay in
the courtyard or stables beside their animals and goods
or else on the galleries.  The snores of a score resounded
into our cubicle.  Yet I slept, awakening at intervals of
the night when a child cried for the breast or a camel broke
loose and threshed around the courtyard or a party of
belated travelers stumbled over the sleepers outside our
door.
</p>

<p>
We were astir early in the morning, and before eight
o'clock Wasso Mikali, Nikka and I left the khan&mdash;Wasso
having given strict injunction to his young men to stick
to their quarters and discourage any endeavors to make
them talk&mdash;to cross the Golden Horn to the European
quarter of Pera.  This walk was no less fascinating than
our ride from the Adrianople Gate.  It took us through
the northeastern half of Stamboul, and after we had passed
the lower bridge of boats, into the comparatively civilized
conditions of the Galata and Pera areas.
</p>

<p>
But to tell the truth, once we had left Stamboul Nikka
and I thought little of our surroundings.  Nikka even
relinquished some of the wolfish manner which his return to
Gypsy life had inspired, and we discussed eagerly, and
not for the first time, the possibility that harm had come
to Hugh.  But our fears were relieved when we came to
the corner of the street opposite the hotel, for there by the
entrance stood Hugh and Watkins chatting with Vernon
King.
</p>

<p>
Nikka led the three of us up to the hotel, shambling
ungracefully and goggling at the Western aspect of the
building and the people who passed on the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
"Anybody covering them?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
I looked around.  On the farther curbstone, smoking and
pretending to be interested in the passers-by, lounged two
individuals who might have been cut from the same
pattern as ourselves; and I indicated them to Nikka as I
offered him tobacco from the box I carried Balkan-fashion
in my waist-sash.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said, "we must be careful.  We'll
move up beside Hugh, and when there's nobody in
earshot you say what you have to say, speaking to me."
</p>

<p>
We peered open-mouthed into the lobby, gaped at
shop-windows and slowly worked to a position close by Hugh
and Vernon King.  I was amused to observe that Watkins
confined his attention to the two spies across the street,
whom he favored with a steady, malignant gaze.  King,
too, was immersed in the conversation.  Hugh gave us one
keen glance, obviously because we were Gypsies.  But he
did not recognize us, and indeed, in our gaudy clothes,
dirty and unshaven, we looked nothing like his memory
of us.
</p>

<p>
"If they don't come in the next few&mdash;" King was saying
as we halted close by, staring at a Levantine lady in
a Parisian frock who was entering a taxi.
</p>

<p>
"Better not," warned Hugh, with a wink toward us.
</p>

<p>
"This is one time we fooled you," I remarked, speaking
in a low tone of voice at Nikka&mdash;there was nobody else
within twenty feet of our groups at the moment.  "Jack
speaking, Hugh.  You and Watty follow us.  Go around
the block the other way from us.  We'll pick you up."
</p>

<p>
Nikka had a bright thought as we started off.  The
Commissionaire at the hotel entrance had been watching us
with suspicion, and Nikka made a pretense of thrusting by
him into the lobby.  The Commissionaire grabbed him
by the arm, and hustled him on to the sidewalk, and at
this we all pretended uneasiness and hurried up the street.
Hugh and Watkins watched us disappear, then said good-by
to King, and walked down the street.  They were rounding
the corner of the farther side of the block as we
entered it, and when we made sure they had seen us, we
turned into a cross-street that led between buildings
toward Galata and the Golden Horn.
</p>

<p>
Hugh's shadows had a poor time of it after that, and I
believe we lost them in the maze of crooked lanes in
Stamboul.  At any rate, they were nowhere in sight when
we dodged into the gateway of the Khan of the Georgians.
Hugh was bursting to talk, but Nikka motioned to him to
be silent.  The appearance of two Europeans like
himself and Watkins was bound to attract some attention, and
we rushed them through the courtyard as rapidly as
possible.  Of course, everybody who noticed them at all
concluded that they were up to no good, considering the
disreputable company they were in.
</p>

<p>
So they panted after us up the steep stairs to the second
gallery, and Wasso Mikali opened the door of our cubicle
and stood aside until Watkins had entered.  Then he
came in, himself, and locked it and squatted down with
his back against it.  He was as imperturbable as Watkins,
which is saying a great deal.  Watkins surveyed the room
with cool disfavor, drew his finger through a smudge of
smoke on the wall and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear, gentlemen," he said.  "They don't do very
well for you 'ere, do they, now?  A proper queer place, I
call it.  And you 'ave changed, too, if I may say so.
Mister Jack, sir, you must let me draw you a 'ot tub, and
I'll give Mister Nikka a shave."
</p>

<p>
We shouted with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"That is supposed to be a disguise, Watty," exploded
Hugh.  "My word, it's a good one!  You lads had me
fooled completely.  I looked at you just as I've looked at
scores of rascals like you, and King and I went on
wondering what had become of you.  I say, who's the old
gent?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka introduced his uncle, and Wasso Mikali met Hugh
with the unstudied courtesy that made it so difficult to
remember that he knew nothing of what we call manners or
the gentler aspects of life.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd tell him how much I appreciate his
assistance," said Hugh.  "And I shall be very glad to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, Hugh," I interrupted.  "Remember, he's
Nikka's uncle.  And besides, he's a king in a small way on
his own."
</p>

<p>
Hugh turned squarely on Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"My mistake, old man," he said.  "I apologize for what
I didn't say.  But will you please give him my thanks, all
the same."
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali's bright eyes, eyes that sparkled with
vitality, took on a humorous gleam.
</p>

<p>
"He says," Nikka translated, chuckling, "that he
appreciates your thanks, but he never does anything for
thanks.  He is here because I am interested and there is
a chance of fighting, and he never loses an opportunity
to draw his knife, if there is loot to be won or a friend
to be aided."
</p>

<p>
"He's a sportsman," approved Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"And there are six more like him in the next room,"
I added.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Nikka, you brought a feudal levy&mdash;what?" Hugh
exclaimed delightedly.  "Well, we shall need them.  This
is going to be a tight job, if you ask me."
</p>

<p>
"Is Toutou here?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not.  So far as we have observed, none of the
headliners has appeared on the scene, but the underlings
are very efficient.  Vernon King and I have been over
the ground rather thoroughly.  He's been a priceless help,
Jack.  Don't know what Watty and I would have done
without him.  He saved us from having to rely on a guide
to learn the city.  And Betty&mdash;she's the most enthusiastic
worker on our side."
</p>

<p>
"She would be," I agreed.  "But you don't mean to
say that you and she have really done any work?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come, now," he expostulated.  "What do you
take me for?  We have worked a lot.  Betty has a
motor-launch her father chartered so they could run up and
down the coast on his archæological trips, and we used
that to mark down the house where we think the treasure
is located."
</p>

<p>
Nikka and I both forgot our Gypsy stoicism, and hitched
forward.  We were sitting on the floor; Hugh and Watkins,
in recognition of their clean clothes were perched
on two packs.
</p>

<p>
"Have you really got a line on the site of the Bucoleon?"
asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh.  "Matter of fact, that was
comparatively easy, thanks to Vernon King.  You see, he
knows his Constantinople of old; and after consulting with
some other learned Johnnies out at Robert College and
several ancient Greeks of the Syllogos, the Historical
Society, you know, he was able to point out quite accurately
the general site of the Great Palace.  When we had gone
so far, it became a case of picking out the building within
that area that held our prize.
</p>

<p>
"In that we were helped by knowing that it was occupied
by a band of Gypsies, who had lived there a long
time.  The Phanariots, Greeks of the Syllogos, I mean,
picked out the building like a shot.  To verify it, we
watched it from the street and also from the motor-launch.
There isn't any doubt about it.  It's in what they call
Sokaki Masyeri, a mean little street in a mean quarter that
skirts the old sea-walls beyond the railroad tracks.
</p>

<p>
"This house is built right on the walls.  It has a kind of
battered magnificence, elaborately carven cornices and
window-moldings, and it rambles over a good bit of
ground, including a fairish-sized courtyard, just as you
would expect of the wreck of an old palace.  To be sure,
it's no more than a small portion of what was the Palace
of the Bucoleon.  As Vernon King pointed out, the man
who started out to excavate the whole site of the Palace
would have to embark in the real estate business on a large
scale and work with steam-dredgers."
</p>

<p>
"And you're positive about all this?" I insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, lord, yes!  There can't be any mistake, Jack.
Why, the bird who lives in this house is the king of the
Stamboul Gypsies, the chief bad man of Constantinople.
He has a whole tribe of cut-throats at his beck and call.
Ask anybody here about Beran Tokalji&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali leaped to his feet at sound of that name
and strode over to us, his hand on his knife.
</p>

<p>
"What's the row?" inquired Hugh as the old Gypsy
and Nikka engaged in a brisk exchange of sibilant phrases.
</p>

<p>
"Our friend has this person Tokalji's number," I
explained.  "He told us about him.  He had heard about
the treasure and the house."
</p>

<p>
"Then we must be right," cried Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"You're right enough," agreed Nikka, while Wasso
Mikali returned to his place by the door and rolled a
cigarette.  "It seems, also, that this Tokalji is a particular
enemy of my uncle.  He was suggesting a little exterminating
expedition."
</p>

<p>
"That's the last move to try," answered Hugh quickly.
"We've got to be very careful.  The authorities were
rather puzzled to account for my continued interest in
the city, at first.  As it is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He turned brick-red to his hair.
</p>

<p>
"As it is," I grinned, "your pursuit of Bet has material
advantages."
</p>

<p>
"Curse you, Jack," he retorted disagreeably, "that's
not the way to put it.  And anyhow, I'm not responsible
for what damnfool officials think."
</p>

<p>
"You are in luck," said Nikka with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Hugh stood up, hot and exasperated.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't come here to be spoofed by a couple of
idiotic rotters," he snapped.  "When you find your senses,
send for me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang on to your temper, Hugh," I said, dropping
my hand on his shoulder.  "Get back to where we were.
You said we must play safe.  We've got six of Nikka's
cousins in the next room, first-class knife-handlers, every
one of them.  With Wasso Mikali and us, that makes
eleven."
</p>

<p>
"And Vernon King is twelve," added Hugh.  "He
wants to be in on the whole business.  It appeals to his
archæological bump, as well as to his sporting tastes.
But we can't have a rough house yet.  We don't know
the ground well enough.  We've got to determine where
the treasure is in that house."
</p>

<p>
"Did you get the copy of the Instructions from Miss
King?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and had her immediately mail it to herself, Poste
Restante, as we agreed.  It's there now.  I don't need it.
I found I had memorized it perfectly.  No, the next step
is to get inside that house, by stealth, if possible, by force,
if every other means fails."

CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
WATKINS PLAYS THE GOAT
</h3>

<p>
"We ought to try to get inside Tokalji's house as
soon as possible, if Toutou and Hélène and
the rest of them are not here yet," said Nikka
slowly.  "Are you sure about that, Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
"To the extent that we haven't seen a sign of them."
</p>

<p>
"They will have been scurrying about our back-trail,"
I suggested.  "Our disappearance must have upset their
plans."
</p>

<p>
"Probably," assented Nikka.  "Yes, if we are going to
profit by that trick we must move soon.  I don't believe
either Jack or I could fool that Cespedes woman.  At the
same time, what Hugh says about the danger of violent
tactics is very true.  We should keep my uncle and his
men as a reserve.  If it ever comes to a cold show-down,
we are going to need more than ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"King and I have talked it over frequently," said Hugh.
"But we haven't been able to think of a safe way of
getting inside.  Of course, we could run ashore in the
launch some night, and climb up the courtyard wall that
fronts on the Bosphorus, but we'd certainly be discovered."
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't work," asserted Nikka.  "No, to get in
and have opportunity to look around for the landmarks
mentioned in the Instructions we must be accepted as
friends."
</p>

<p>
"It can't be done," protested Hugh at once.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, it can.  Jack and I can do it&mdash;with Watkins
to help us."
</p>

<p>
Watkins started up from the pack upon which he had
been endeavoring to appear comfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, now, Mr. Nikka!  I never 'eard the like!  Your
ludship, I protest, I do!  I wasn't cut out for a Gypsy.
Can you see me in such clothes?  It's not decent, your
ludship, for a man of my years to be going in public
dressed like a pantomime."
</p>

<p>
"We're not going to make a Gypsy out of you, Watty,"
returned Nikka, waving him to silence.  "You are going
to be the innocent victim of two outrageous bandits."
</p>

<p>
"That's worse," groaned Watkins.  "I'll do my duty,
your ludship, and take what comes, but there's no call
for all this wild talk, if I may say so, sir, and what does
it all lead to?  And I'm mortal sure, your ludship, there's
bugs in this room.  'Adn't we better be getting back to
the 'Otel, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," commanded Hugh.  "Nobody's stuck you
up yet.  What's your plan, Nikka?"
</p>

<p>
"Just this.  When we leave here you and Watkins head
for Tokalji's house.  We'll follow you at a distance.  You
and Watty must prowl through the street as mysteriously
as you can, looking up at the house, examining its
approaches, all that sort of thing.  Make sure the street is
empty&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's always empty," interrupted Hugh.  "It's
crescent-shaped, with comparatively few houses opening on
it, a backwater."
</p>

<p>
"That helps.  Now, when you get into the street look
back and you will see us lurking after you.  Pretend to
be scared.  Then we'll go after you, knives out.  Run.
You get away, Hugh, but we catch Watty and throw him
down&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it 'ad to be me, gentlemen," sighed Watkins.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;empty out his pockets, start to cut his throat&mdash;you'd
better not be wriggling about that time, Watty, or the
knife might slip&mdash;and you raise a yell for the police around
the corner.  We change our minds, kick Watty on his way
and run back.  At the gate of Tokalji's house we ask for
admission, claiming we fear pursuit.  I think&mdash;I am quite
sure&mdash;they will let us in.  It is a chance we must take.
They will have seen what we did, and from what you and
Wasso Mikali tell me, Tokalji considers himself the chief
of the local criminals.  He will demand a percentage of
our loot, and let it go at that."
</p>

<p>
"A nice time will be 'ad by all," commented Watkins.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds simple," I said.  "But what about me?"
</p>

<p>
"You are a Frenchman, an ex-Apache and deserter from
the Salonika troops.  Let me do the talking.  I know
Gypsies.  If you tell them a bold tale, and carry a high
bluff, they will take you at your own valuation."
</p>

<p>
"It's a plan worth trying," agreed Hugh.  "But you
can't expect to stay with Tokalji forever."
</p>

<p>
"I know that.  We'll do the best we can."
</p>

<p>
"Start now?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait until afternoon.  That will drive your shadows
insane, and they will be doubling back to the hotel on
the chance of picking you up again."
</p>

<p>
We spent the balance of the time together hashing over
our experiences, and horrifying Watkins by revealing to
him the state of our apparel.  Incidentally, we arranged
to have complete changes of European clothes sent to us
at the khan, so that if it became necessary we could shift
rôles inside the protecting walls of the great caravanserai.
</p>

<p>
When the hour came to leave, Wasso Mikali and his
young men escorted Hugh and Watkins through the courtyard,
and Nikka and I followed at some distance.  The
Gypsies stopped in the gateway, and we strolled on alone
after our friends in the direction of the Bosphorus.  We
had walked for upwards of an hour along the narrow
lanes, up-hill and down-hill, elbowing a passage through
the sordid stream of life, when from an elevation we
glimpsed the sheen of water, and Hugh, a hundred feet
in front of us, tossed his head as if in invitation to press on.
</p>

<p>
We accepted the hint, and as they rounded an alley-corner
into a dingy lane that was over-topped midway by a wall
of massive Roman construction we were close at their
heels.  Now the comedy began.  Hugh played up in great
shape.  He drew a paper from his pocket, and affected to
stare along the wall.  He counted his steps.  He looked
around him fearfully.  He conferred with Watkins, who
manifested even more uneasiness.  It was Watty who
looked behind them, and spied us, peering around a
flair of stonework.  It was Watty, too, I am bound to say,
who undertook to measure the height of the wall by
contrast with his own stature&mdash;at least, he appeared to be
doing so.  Afterwards he denied that he had had any
thought of this.  He was only trying to get as far away as
possible from us&mdash;we "fair gave 'im the creeps."
</p>

<p>
We slunk into the alley in as hangdog a manner as we
could manage.  Watty called Hugh's attention to us, as we
thought, with genuine dramatic art.  We heard later that
he remarked: "It ain't right, your ludship, these
carryings-on!  I don't 'old for me own skin, but there's Mister
Jack and Mister Nikka little knowing what they'll be
getting theirselfs into."  To which Hugh says he replied:
"Steady on, old Boot-trees!  England expects every man
to take his beating."
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, as Nikka whipped out his knife and ran for
them, Watty squeaked, and lit off with a considerable
lead on Hugh.  But Hugh wasted no breath.  He sprinted
and lunged into Watkins, knocking him against a
house-wall, so that we had time to catch up.  And as Hugh
reached the curve of the crescent-shaped street, Nikka
overhauled Watkins and toppled him over with every
appearance of ruthless brutality.  In the next moment I
added my knife to the picture, and while I menaced the
poor old chap's throat, Nikka scientifically emptied his
pockets and ripped a money-belt from under his clothes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mister Nikka, sir," moaned Watkins.  "Not that,
sir.  There wasn't anything said about me belt, sir.  Do
be careful with that knife, Mister Jack.  It's me throat,
sir, if I may say so.  Not the belt, Mister Nikka!  Oh,
dear, sir, whatever will I do about me trousers?  Torn me
apart, you 'ave.  Ow!"
</p>

<p>
This last as Nikka gave every indication of intending to
cut his heart out.  There came a yell from Hugh around
the corner, and Nikka bounded to his feet.  Between us
we hoisted Watkins to his, and propelled him from us with
a couple of really brutal kicks.  Collar torn, jacket scruffed
and trousers unbraced, Watkins scudded for that corner
like a swallow on the wing.  But we did not wait to watch
his exit.  We took to our own heels, and headed in the
opposite direction, hesitated at the far corner, and doubled
back to the closed door that was buried in the high wall
of Tokalji's house.
</p>

<p>
Nikka banged the thick wood with his knife-hilt.
</p>

<p>
"Who knocks?" rumbled a voice.
</p>

<p>
"Two who fear the police."
</p>

<p>
A small wicket opened.
</p>

<p>
"We want none such here."  And to one within: "Be
still."
</p>

<p>
"There is something to be divided," answered Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you come from?"
</p>

<p>
"Salonika&mdash;and elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Tziganes both?"  And again to one unseen: "I said
be still, little devil."
</p>

<p>
"My comrade is a Frank&mdash;but he is one of us."
</p>

<p>
A hinge creaked.
</p>

<p>
"Enter," growled the voice.  "Quickly."
</p>

<p>
The crack was wide enough for one at a time, and we
slid through like shadows, the open leaf slamming behind
us.  We stood in a large courtyard.  To right and left
were solid, timeworn buildings, two stories high.  In front
was a broken wall, partially built over by a structure of
moldy brick, but there was a gap sufficiently large to
reveal the Bosphorus.  The court was cluttered with bales
of goods and boxes and a number of men and women in
Gypsy dress who were occupied in staring at us.
</p>

<p>
But we did not spare any protracted attention for them.
There were two far more interesting characters close at
hand.  One was a stalwart, black-bearded man, with a
seamed, wicked face that wore an habitual scowl.  The
other was a girl of perhaps eighteen, whose lissome figure
set off her ragged dress like a Paquin toilette.  She was
very brown.  Her hair was a tumbled heap of midnight,
and her eyes were great glowing depths of passion.  Her
shapely legs were bare almost to the knee, and her flimsy
bodice scarcely covered her.  But she carried herself with
the unconsciously regal air that I had noticed in Wasso
Mikali.
</p>

<p>
She regarded me almost with contempt, but her eyes
fairly devoured Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"This is the one," she cried, "he ran like that stallion
we had from the Arab of Nejd, and you should have seen
him strip the old Frank.  He would have had the other
one too if his friend had been as swift.  Heh,
foster-father, he has the makings of a great thief!"[<a id="chap15fn1text"></a><a href="#chap15fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap15fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap15fn1text">1</a>] Nikka afterwards translated these conversations for me.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But the man only glowered at us, his hand on the hilt
of one of the long knives in his waist-sash.
</p>

<p>
"Be still, girl!  You jabber like a crow."
</p>

<p>
"And you snarl like a wolf, Old One," she retorted.
"I say I saw them."
</p>

<p>
"Somewhat of it I saw myself," he admitted, "but is
that a reason for taking strangers in from the street?
Who knows them?"
</p>

<p>
"Nobody," answered Nikka promptly.  "Only our
knives can speak for us."
</p>

<p>
"Heh, many a man has a knife that talks!"  The fellow's
grin was fiendish.  "A talking knife!  It says three
words."  He flashed his own in the air.  "Haugh!"  It
whistled down in a deadly thrust.  "Sss-sssrr-kk!  And
it goes home.  Drip-drip!  And the tale is told.  That is
all a knife can say."
</p>

<p>
And he sheathed his own, still grinning.
</p>

<p>
"That is why a sure knife is valuable," returned Nikka.
"A pistol, now.  That shouts aloud.  But a knife only
whispers, and if a knife knows but three words, how many
of its masters can have that said of them?"
</p>

<p>
"You talk more than most, it seems," leered the bearded
man.  He was quick of wit.
</p>

<p>
"I have said what I have said," stated Nikka, folding
his arms.  "My comrade and I are new to Stamboul.  We
have heard of Beran Tokalji in many camps.  In the
winter we were in Paris, the great city of the Franks, and
there, too, men spoke of Tokalji.  A great thief, they said,
and one who treated his people well."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that I am Tokalji?" demanded the
bearded man, plainly flattered by Nikka's speech.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Nikka did not know him, but he was quick to
seize the opportunity and make the most of it.
</p>

<p>
"I have often heard you described around the fires.  It
was enough to see the way you handle a knife.  'As sure
as the knife of Tokalji' is the saying all along the road
from Salonika to Buda and beyond into the Frank countries."
</p>

<p>
"If you knew me and sought my help, was it wise to
rob in front of my door?" countered Tokalji, but the scowl
on his face was supplanted by a smirk.
</p>

<p>
Nikka affected embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"Why, as to that, voivode, there is something to be said,"
he agreed.  "But we saw the Franks, and their looks spelt
gold, and&mdash;what would you?  'Twas a chance.  Also, we
thought the police would not dare to touch us here."
</p>

<p>
"That may be true," Tokalji agreed in his turn.  "But
there are Frank soldiers in Pera, and how if they came
here to seize you?"
</p>

<p>
"But the Franks did not see us enter," said Nikka.
</p>

<p>
The girl thrust herself scornfully to the fore.
</p>

<p>
"Gabble, gabble, gabble," she mocked.  "Are we old
wives that we mouth over everything?  These men robbed,
they fled unseen, they have their loot.  Foster-father, you
are not so keen as you once were.  Something was said of
a division."
</p>

<p>
A greedy light dawned in Tokalji's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," he insisted, "that is right.  So you said,
my lad, and if you would have shelter you must pay for
it."
</p>

<p>
"So will I."
</p>

<p>
Nikka flung the money-belt, some loose change and a
watch down on the ground, and squatted beside them.  The
rest of us did the same.  The girl seized the belt, and
emptied the compartments, one by one.
</p>

<p>
"English gold," she exclaimed.  "This was worth taking.
You are a man of judgment, friend&mdash;  What is your
name?"
</p>

<p>
"I am called Giorgi Bordu.  My friend is named Jakka
in the Tzigane camps.  The name he bore in his own
country is buried under a killing."
</p>

<p>
She looked at me more respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh-ho, so he has killed, has he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, maiden.  He is not a Gypsy, so with the knife&mdash;"  Nikka
shrugged his shoulders in deprecation&mdash;"but with
his hands, and the pistol, now!  You should see him when
there is quick work to be done."
</p>

<p>
She began shifting the money into three equal piles.
</p>

<p>
"Did he have any papers, that Frank?" asked Tokalji
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"All that he had is there," replied Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!"  The Gypsy thought for a moment.  "It
was strange that you attacked those two, Giorgi Bordu.  I
do not want them sneaking around here.  They are after
something that I want myself."
</p>

<p>
Nikka, sitting back on his heels, produced his tobacco-box
and rolled a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps a strange thief and his friend might be of
aid to you," he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they might.  I don't know&mdash;  You are smart
fellows, I can see that.  And I need men like you.  But
I am not alone in this.  There are others, do you see?  I
must consult them.  Still, you should be better than the
two I am using just now."
</p>

<p>
"Are they Tziganes?" inquired Nikka politely.
</p>

<p>
"Of a sort.  But they have lived too long with the
Franks.  They are not so ready as they once were, and I
find they do not bring me the information I require.  I
make no promises, but suppose I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The girl screamed, and I twisted on my haunches to see
that Nikka had seized her wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go, pig," she hissed, and reached for her knife
with her free hand; but Nikka caught that, too.
</p>

<p>
Tokalji stared at them both unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?" he barked.  "Do you assail my people
already before you are accepted a member of my tribe?"
</p>

<p>
"I am protecting your purse and mine from this little
thief," answered Nikka calmly.  "While we talked, she
stole."
</p>

<p>
"He lies," spat the girl.  "There is the money."
</p>

<p>
She stretched a slim brown foot toward the three little
piles on the sunken flagstones.  Tokalji drew his knife.
</p>

<p>
"If you take liberties with me I will carve out your
bowels," he warned savagely.
</p>

<p>
Nikka's reply was to rake open the girl's bodice with
his hooked fingers.  A stream of coins tinkled on the
pavement.  He released her, and she leaped back out of his
reach, staring down at him with a puzzled look in her
eyes, entirely regardless of her nakedness.
</p>

<p>
Tokalji burst out laughing, and resheathed his knife.
</p>

<p>
"She is a rare one.  You are the first to catch her so."
</p>

<p>
"And he will be the last!" she said in a low, tense voice.
</p>

<p>
A wave of color suffused her from breast to forehead.
But it was from rage, not modesty.  She ripped a dagger
from her waist.
</p>

<p>
"Now, we shall see if you can fight or only boast,"
she rasped, crouching forward.
</p>

<p>
Nikka shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't fight with women," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better fight with her," said Tokalji philosophically,
"or she will kill you.  She has a swifter blade than
any man of my tribe."
</p>

<p>
Nikka sank back on his haunches.
</p>

<p>
"I will not draw my knife," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then you will die," she hissed, and charged.
</p>

<p>
I rose, and made to intervene, but Tokalji drew his
knife again and came between us.
</p>

<p>
"Let her have her chance, man," he ordered in his
snarling voice, and before I could pass him she struck.
</p>

<p>
But her knife was stayed in mid air.  Nikka's arm
darted out, his fingers clutched her wrist, there was a
wrench&mdash;and the knife clattered beside the stolen coins.
He forced her down by his side, picked up the knife and
handed it to her.  Then turned his back, and resumed his
conversation with Tokalji.
</p>

<p>
"You were speaking of information you required," he
said.
</p>

<p>
Tokalji eyed him in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Do you wear the death-shirt that you care so little
for death?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Death comes when it is ready," returned Nikka
impassively.  "Is a man to fear a maiden?"
</p>

<p>
"Many men fear that maiden," retorted Tokalji grimly.
"Heh, you are a fighter.  We will accept your comrade
for whatever he is.  You I know I can use.  Kara!"
</p>

<p>
The girl looked at him sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Take the strangers to Mother Kathene.  Tell her to
bed them with the young men."
</p>

<p>
She stood up, her half-clad Dryad's body shining a
golden bronze hue.
</p>

<p>
"I am not afraid of you, Giorgi Bordu," she said,
humbly fearless.  "You turned aside my knife with your
bare hand, and my life is yours.  Will you take it?"
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, she pulled aside what scanty rags
remained of her bodice, and exposed her breast for his
knife.  Nikka regarded her curiously, and a light I had
never seen there before gleamed momentarily in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Your life is your own, maiden," he answered.  "But
remember I steal from others.  Others do not steal from
me."
</p>

<p>
"That is as it should be," she said.  "You are a
voivode, a chief.  I knew you were no ordinary man when
I saw you hunt down the old Frank in the street.  I said
to myself: 'That man is a great thief.  He must be the
king of a tribe.'  To-night," she added royally, "I will
pay ransom for my life.  I will dance for you."
</p>

<p>
Tokalji emitted a peculiar gurgling sound which was
intended for laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Heh, Giorgi Bordu, have you by chance been a bear-tamer?"
he asked as he swept up his pile of gold and
turned away.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
THE RED STONE
</h3>

<p>
Nikka and I pouched our shares of the loot we
had brought in, Nikka appropriating to
himself Watkins's Birmingham silver watch.  The
Gypsy girl never took her eyes off him as she absently
refastened her tattered bodice.
</p>

<p>
"We are ready," said Nikka.
</p>

<p>
Her face flowered in an instantaneous smile.
</p>

<p>
"It is well, Giorgi Bordu.  Come with me."
</p>

<p>
She led us across the courtyard to the building which
fronted it on the left and was extended by the brick
addition I have spoken of to shut in partially the rear of
the court which abutted on the Bosphorus.  A man was
leaning over in the doorway, strapping up a bundle, and
Kara planted her bare foot in the middle of his back,
sending him sprawling.  He was up in a flash, with his
knife out and his face distorted with anger; but when he
saw who had kicked him, the anger turned to smiles.  He
swung the bundle on his shoulder and swaggered off.
And Kara looked at Nikka, with the expectant manner of
a child who has performed a trick and expects to be
applauded for it.
</p>

<p>
I grinned.  I couldn't help it.  But Nikka only
motioned impatiently to the doorway.  She caught her lip
in a pout, dug her toes in the dust and affected not to
understand him; but Nikka took one stride, with arm
extended, and she danced away, all smiles again.
Apparently, she didn't mind as long as she made him look
at her.
</p>

<p>
Inside the door was a big, stone-paved hall.  There
were traces of carvings on the capitals of the pillars and
a spaciousness that spoke of ancient glories.  The stairs
that led to the upper story were railed with marble and
grooved deep by the tread of countless feet.  But the
place reeked with the squalor of a tenement.  Three old
women were huddled in front of a fire that blazed on an
enormous hearth, and strings of onions and garlic hung
from hooks in the ceiling.  All around were scattered
dirty piles of blankets and personal belongings.
</p>

<p>
Kara skipped across to the fireplace, and tapped the
oldest of the three women on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Hi, Mother Kathene," she called loudly.  "Here are
two strangers Beran has taken into the tribe."
</p>

<p>
The three hags tottered to their feet, and peered at us
with bleared eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Strangers?" whined Mother Kathene.  "Why strangers
in the tribe?  Haven't we enough fine young men to
stab and steal for the chief?  Heh-heh!  I don't like
strangers."
</p>

<p>
"Strangers are bad luck," pronounced a second
beldame, whose name was Zitzi.
</p>

<p>
"Bad luck," echoed the third, who was called Lilli.
"And I suppose we'll have to cook and scrub for the
rascals, too."
</p>

<p>
Kara pinched her with a viciousness that made the poor
old thing squeal.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk of scrubbing to me!" she sneered.  "You
wouldn't touch water to a foul pot, let alone a man's
clothes.  You'd drown if you were rained on.  Bah,
Mother Lilli, you are lucky to have a chief like Beran,
who gives the old ones work to do and shelter and food
for the end of their days, instead of driving them out
to seek the bounty of the Roumis and Franks.  And you
are luckier still to have a great thief like Giorgi Bordu
to cook for.  He is the greatest thief in the world.  Why,
he even caught me when I would have stolen from
him!"
</p>

<p>
"If he steals well, he won't be a fighter," mumbled
Mother Kathene.  "What about the other one?"
</p>

<p>
"He took my knife from me without drawing his own,"
flared Kara.  "No other man in the tribe could do that.
The other?  Oh, he is a Frank."
</p>

<p>
"More bad luck," wailed old Zitzi.  "Tzigane folk
who live with Franks are always spoiled.  They worship
the Christian goddess or they grow clumsy or they lose
their courage or they take the spotted sickness."
</p>

<p>
Kara clouted her on the head.
</p>

<p>
"Have done with it," she commanded imperiously.
"Where are Giorgi and Jakka to lie?"
</p>

<p>
"Where they choose," returned Zitzi sourly.
</p>

<p>
Kara waved her hand about the chamber.
</p>

<p>
"Here or above, whichever you say," she announced
to us.  "These are the quarters of the young men."
</p>

<p>
"May we look above?" asked Nikka, anxious to seize
this opportunity to explore.
</p>

<p>
Her answer was to dance up the stairs&mdash;she seldom
walked or did anything slowly.
</p>

<p>
We followed her.  There was a central corridor, and
from it opened various rooms, some of them crammed
with all manner of goods, valuable rugs, bric-a-brac,
cloths, and frequently, the veriest junk.
</p>

<p>
"Beran stores plunder here, as you can see," she said.
"The other rooms are empty.  The young men prefer to
sleep all together where they can watch one another."
</p>

<p>
Nikka realized that if we set up a different standard
of conduct from that observed by our brother bachelors
we would prejudice our position in this strange
community.
</p>

<p>
"What is good enough for them is good enough for us,"
he decided.  "But is there no more to see?  I thought
the building ran around by the water."
</p>

<p>
"There is no connection," she replied.  "The building
over the water is just a storehouse.  We are a great tribe,
and Beran has agents everywhere.  Never a day goes by
that plunder does not come in, and we store it until there
is opportunity to dispose of it."
</p>

<p>
"He is a master thief," agreed Nikka.  "So we had
heard.  But where do you live, maiden?"
</p>

<p>
Her face glowed rosily with satisfaction at this first
evidence of his interest in herself.
</p>

<p>
"Across the court," she answered.  "Come and you
shall see."
</p>

<p>
We descended the stairs into the big hall on the ground-floor,
where the three hags had crouched again before the
fire, and crossed the courtyard to the building opposite on
the right of the entrance.  It was long and graceful in
appearance, beautifully built of a hard white marble,
which had been coated with dirt for centuries.  The
cornices were elaborately sculptured in a conventional
design; the window openings were carved and set with a
light mastery that disguised their bulk.
</p>

<p>
The door was supported by simple pillars of wonderful
green stone that contrived to show its color through the
accumulation of filth which tried to mask it.  How such
pillars could have escaped the antiquary I do not know.
They were as handsome as anything in St. Sophia.  But
then, as we were to discover, the whole abode of Beran
Tokalji constituted an amazing shrine of Byzantine art,
perhaps the most remarkable non-ecclesiastical remnant
in the city.
</p>

<p>
But of all this I thought little at the time.  What
interested me more than anything was that immediately
above the door on a panel let into the wall was carved a
representation of a bull, head lowered and in act to charge.
I looked at Nikka, and his eyes met mine with a warning
glance to say nothing.  It was a good thing that my
knowledge of Gypsy dialect was sketchy, for had I been
able to, I believe I should have exclaimed over this first
clue and attempted to probe our guide's knowledge of it.
</p>

<p>
Kara never gave the sculpture a glance; it meant nothing
to her.  She beckoned us inside the door.  Here again
was a spacious, pillared hall, triple-aisled like a small
church, its battered pavement showing traces here and
there of the gorgeous mosaics which once had floored it.
Whatever decorations adorned its walls were obscured by
the incrustations of centuries of misuse.  The pillars were
of different stones, many of them semi-precious, and
occasionally glinting pink or red or green or yellow through
their drab coats of dirt and soot.  At one end was an
apse-like space large enough to hold a dinner table or a throne,
and on the curving wall I fancied I could discern faint
traces of one of those mosaic portraits with which the
Byzantine artists loved to adorn their buildings.
</p>

<p>
But this superb chamber was littered with the odds and
ends of a people accustomed to dwell in tents.  I suppose
Tokalji's tribe, by all accounts we had, had been living
here for some hundreds of years, yet they never adapted
themselves to urban conditions.  Generation after
generation looked upon this wonderful fragment of one of the
world's stateliest palaces as no more than the four walls
and a roof required to keep out rain and cold.  The
windows were covered by wooden shutters.  Cleaning was
resorted to only when the atmosphere became unsupportable
for the salted nostrils of the tribe.
</p>

<p>
"These are the quarters of the married people,"
explained Kara.  "Beran sleeps here."  She pointed to a
pallet in the recess that I likened to an apse.  "The others
upstairs."
</p>

<p>
"And you?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I live where I choose, but most of all I like my
garden."
</p>

<p>
"Your garden?  Where is there a garden?"
</p>

<p>
"I will show you, Giorgi Bordu."
</p>

<p>
At the end of the hall opposite the apse there was a worn
stone stair.  The shallow steps descended straight to an
opening, barred by a rude pine door.  As we passed it, I
noted idly holes in the stone lintels where formerly had
been cemented the bolts of heavy metal hinges.  A gate,
perhaps.  Beyond the door was a pleasant room in which
several women sewed, and children scrabbled in the dirt
on the floor.  The sunlight poured in from windows
facing us.  I saw trees tossing, heard the splash of water.
</p>

<p>
Kara crossed the room, with a nod to the women, and
opened another door.  This led to a pillared portico, and
I gasped in wonder at the sheer loveliness of this morsel
of imperial Byzantium, buried in the frowsy lanes of
Stamboul.  There was a tangled stretch of garden,
weed-grown, of course, and two jade-green cedars that lifted
their heads in isolated majesty.  Around the four sides
ran the portico, although in two places the pillars had
collapsed and the wreckage of the roof strewed the ground.
But the gem of the place was the fountain in the center, a
lion rearing back on his hind-legs with a broken spear in
his chest.  From his open mouth poured a stream of
water that fell into a stone-rimmed pool.
</p>

<p>
"That is where I swim," volunteered Kara.  "It is
not far, but I can beat you across it.  Would you like me
to try?"
</p>

<p>
And with that pagan innocence which characterized her,
she started to drop skirt and bodice.
</p>

<p>
"Another time," said Nikka, laughing, and with a single
look to see if he was in earnest in refusing such sport, she
promptly refastened her clothes.  "This is lower than the
rest of the house, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
She assented, and it was then that I recovered from the
bewilderment inspired by the unexpected charm of the
picture, and realized for the first time what it meant.  The
bull above the entrance door, the hall, the stair, the marks
of heavy hinges at its foot where a gate had hung, the room
where the women sat, an atrium, in the old Roman
architecture; the garden&mdash;by Jove, even the cedars!&mdash;the Garden
of the Cedars; and the Fountain of the Lion!  It was
exactly as the first Hugh had described it in the missing
half of the Instructions which we had found.
</p>

<p>
I dug my fingers into Nikka's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," he said quietly in English.  "I see it, too.
But do not let yourself seem excited."
</p>

<p>
Involuntarily I repeated to myself the concluding
sentences of the Instructions which we had all memorized:
</p>

<p>
"From the center of the Fountain take four paces west
toward the wall of the atrium.  Then walk three paces
north.  Underfoot is a red stone an ell square."
</p>

<p>
The center of the Fountain&mdash;where could that be?  The
pool stretched sidewise to us, as we stood in front of the
atrium.  Plainly, then, it was intended to mean from the
center of the pedestal on which the lion was perched.  I
stepped out from the portico, measured with my eye the
distance from the pedestal west toward the wall of the
atrium, and walked north on the paved walk which rimmed
the central grass-plot.
</p>

<p>
The flagging here, while naturally worn by the passage
of time, was as even as though it had been laid yesterday.
It was composed of blocks of red and brown granite in a
checker-board pattern, but they seemed to be only a foot
square.  It was not until I passed the center of the
fountain that I discovered that at regular intervals a larger
stone was inserted in the design.  And sure enough, I
found a red one about three and a half paces, as I roughly
made it, in a northerly line from the point I had calculated
as four paces west of the center of the fountain.
</p>

<p>
Kara had no eyes for any one save Nikka, and I ventured
to stamp my sandaled heel on the stone as I trod
over it.  It gave back no different sound from those on
either side of it, but when my first disappointment had
passed, I told myself that this was no more than could
have been expected.  Had it sounded hollow, surely, some
person in the course of seven centuries would have noticed
it, and whether possessed of knowledge of the treasure or
not, must have had sufficient enterprise to attempt to find
what it concealed.
</p>

<p>
I walked on around the garden, determined to take
advantage of this extraordinary opportunity to survey the
ground.  But there was nothing else to see.  On one side
the porticos fringed a blank wall, evidently belonging to
the adjoining property.  Vernon King afterwards said
that at some period this group of buildings of the Palace
of the Bucoleon had been cut up into separate structures
and built together in blocks.  On the side toward the
Bosphorus a wing of the building we had traversed
intervened.  Through the frequent windows I saw Gypsy men
and women and a few children lounging or occupied with
their household duties or playing.  One of the men was
teaching a boy to pick pockets.  I watched him for some
time with interest.
</p>

<p>
I finally abandoned my investigations because I
gathered from the tones of their voices that Nikka was
having an argument with Kara.  When I came up to them,
Nikka was offering her Watkins's watch; but she dashed
it to the pavement, burst into tears and fled back the way
we had come.
</p>

<p>
"What have you been doing, Lothario?" I demanded in
French.
</p>

<p>
Nikka looked very unhappy.
</p>

<p>
"She wanted me to kiss her.  I&mdash;I offered her that
watch, in the first place.  To make up for showing her up
the way I did; that was to impress Tokalji, of course.  And
then I thought she had been pretty decent to us since."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay she has been," I agreed.  "For a purpose,
to be sure."
</p>

<p>
"A purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she asked you for something, didn't she?" I
gibed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that!"  Nikka's discomfort was heart-warming.
"She doesn't know any better, Jack.  I've seen her kind
before&mdash;at least, none as bright as she or quite as pretty;
but the same kind of untamed wild-cats.  We Gypsies spoil
our women if they have any spirit.  And she&mdash;  Well, you
could see for yourself.  She has been brought up in this
atmosphere.  Crime is an art with her.  She looks upon
a clever robbery as you do on a good job of architecture.
She has lived with men ever since she left her mother's
arms.  She doesn't know what it means to be refused any
thing.  She&mdash;she's all right, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I know she's the prettiest savage creature I've ever
seen," I returned drily.  "Since she is the first, however,
that may not mean much.  You seem to be very anxious to
explain her savagery, my friend.  Why didn't you kiss
her?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka picked up the watch and examined the broken
crystal.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we'd better stay here," he answered
vaguely.  "Women's quarters, and all that sort of thing.
Hullo, here's Tokalji, now!"
</p>

<p>
The Gypsy chief stalked out of the atrium.
</p>

<p>
"What have you been doing to the girl?" he growled.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't kiss her," said Nikka with a sudden grin.
</p>

<p>
Tokalji's bearded face was cracked by a burst of
gargoyle laughter.
</p>

<p>
"You are a wise one!  I said so!  I know men, I, Beran
Tokalji!  But hark you," and his tone took on an edge,
"be careful with her.  She is all I have, and I give her
to no man I do not know.  You come in out of the street,
whoever you are.  Prove yourself, and I can make much
of you.  But until you prove yourself, you and this Frank
jackal with you, you walk carefully and jump when you
hear the lash."
</p>

<p>
"Is she your daughter?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind who she is.  What are you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"She was showing us the fountain."
</p>

<p>
"That is all right.  But the young men stay out of this
house.  I want no troubles over women in the tribe.
Remember that, you two."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
THE DANCE IN THE COURTYARD
</h3>

<p>
Tokalji herded us through the atrium and up
the stairs into the large chamber with the apse
where he, himself, slept.
</p>

<p>
"Sit," he ordered roughly, motioning to several stools.
"I have something to say."
</p>

<p>
He went to a chest in the corner, and drew from it a
bottle of rakia, raw Oriental brandy.  I looked about for
a cup as he handed it to Nikka, but my comrade, better
versed in the customs of the country, deftly wiped the
bottle's neck with his coat-sleeve, hoisted it for a long
dram, wiped the neck again and passed it to me.  I
imitated him as well as I could, although a passing
acquaintance with Cognac in my days as a student at the Beaux
Arts and also in the A.E.F. did not save me from a choking
sensation as the fiery liquid burned my gullet.  Tokalji
regarded me with contempt when I handed it to him, tilted
the bottle bottom-up and drained the equivalent of a
water-glass, with a smack of gusto.
</p>

<p>
"There," he said, setting the bottle on the floor.  "We'll
talk better wet than dry&mdash;although I will say, Giorgi, your
friend is no great hand at the bottle.  I hope he's a
better thief."
</p>

<p>
"Only try him," said Nikka eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Humph, I may!  But to be frank with you, my lad,
I don't want you two for a thieving job.  It's something
more difficult, and the reward will be in proportion."
</p>

<p>
Nikka permitted his fingers to caress the hilt of his
knife.
</p>

<p>
"We should enjoy a good killing," he hinted.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Giorgi.  That will come in time, but whatever
else you do, you must keep your knife sheathed in this
business.  As it happens, the men we are after are worth
more to us alive than dead."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you say, voivode," answered Nikka equably.
"But what about your own men?  They're a likely-looking lot."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but not so many of them have the gifts I require
in this service," retorted Tokalji, lifting the bottle
once more.  "They are clever thieves and fighters, but
what I require now is men who can follow and spy.  My
best men at that work have failed to produce anything
worth while in two weeks, and moreover, they have become
known to our enemies.  I must have new men, and abler
men."
</p>

<p>
He bent his brows in a ferocious grimace.
</p>

<p>
"If you succeed, you are my friends.  You shall have
rich pickings.  But if you fail you had better leave
Stamboul."
</p>

<p>
Nikka dropped his hand again on his knife.
</p>

<p>
"Why threaten?" he asked coolly.
</p>

<p>
Tokalji glared at him with the blankly savage menace
of an old gorilla.
</p>

<p>
"Beware how you defy Beran Tokalji in his own den,"
he snarled.  "Well, let it pass.  It shows you have spirit,
but do not tempt me too far, Giorgi.  When I am aroused
I must taste blood."
</p>

<p>
Nikka rose.
</p>

<p>
"I am a free man," he answered casually.  "So is my
comrade, Jakka.  We sell our knives and our fingers to
the best bidder, and if we don't like the treatment we
say so and leave."
</p>

<p>
Tokalji regarded him uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said gruffly, offering the bottle, "drink
again and think better of it, man.  No harm is done by
plain talk.  That's right.  Sit.  I get along with those
who don't fear me too much.  You shall not be sorry
you strayed in here&mdash;but you must deal honestly with me.
I am buying your wits, and I expect something for my
money."
</p>

<p>
"So far it is only we who have paid," retorted Nikka.
"How much are we to get?"
</p>

<p>
"How much?  It depends upon how much we win.
There will be hundreds of gold pieces for every man if
it goes right."
</p>

<p>
"If what goes right?"
</p>

<p>
Tokalji hitched his stool closer to us, and glanced around.
</p>

<p>
"See you, Giorgi&mdash;and you, too, Jakka, if you can
understand any of this talk,&mdash;the two Franks you robbed
live at the hotel in Pera, where all the rich Franks stay."
</p>

<p>
"We saw it this morning," assented Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"These two Franks are an English lord and his servant.
They seek something which I also seek and with them in
their venture are two others, an Amerikansky, Nash, and
one named Zaranko, who, they say, is a fiddler and was
one of our people in his youth."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard of that one," said Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Would you know his face?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I would."
</p>

<p>
"Good! Above everything else we wish to learn what
has become of the Americansky and the fiddler and when
they are to arrive.  Also, they are two more Franks at
the hotel, a man named King and his daughter.  They, I
think, are Amerikansky like Nash.  We do not understand
how they come to be in this business.  If they are really
in it, perhaps it would be worth while to kidnap the girl.
We might hold her to blackmail her friends."
</p>

<p>
"But what do they seek that you also seek?" asked
Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"If you breathe it to a soul, I will cut out your heart
with my own knife, I, Beran Tokalji," replied the Gypsy
chief by way of preface.  "They have the secret to a
treasure."
</p>

<p>
"What?" exclaimed Nikka with great pretense of
astonishment.  "Here in Stamboul?"
</p>

<p>
"Close by, my lad, close by.  They know its location,
but if we are smart we should be able to take it from
them as soon as they reveal their knowledge.  It is for
us to find out their secret or wring it from them, by
torture, if necessary."
</p>

<p>
"This is a job worth doing," cried Nikka, jumping up.
"Jakka and I will be diligent.  We will start now to trail
the Franks."
</p>

<p>
But Tokalji barred the door to him.
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast, not so fast," he answered with his
gargoyle laughter.  "The job has waited for you some time.
It can wait a few hours longer.  I prefer to keep you
under my wing for the night, until we become better
acquainted.  You look like the right sort of fellow, Giorgi,
and your friend is not so poor a man for a Frank; but
after all, as I said to you, you came in to me from the
street this afternoon, and all I know about you is that you
are a good thief.
</p>

<p>
"It is not enough.  I must know more.  And for another
thing, it will help you to await the return of the
two I have out watching these Franks in Pera.  They have
not found much, but they can tell you something of what
the Franks do and how they spend their time.  So make
yourselves comfortable.  You shall eat heartily, and this
evening Kara will dance in the courtyard as she promised
you.  That is worth waiting for, Giorgi.  If I were a
young fellow, I would rather do that than lurk the
corners of Pera.  Heh-heh!"
</p>

<p>
He stepped aside, and waved us permission to go; and
we walked through the courtyard to the crumbling wall
which rimmed the Bosphorus at one point, its base a
rubble-heap, its battlements in fragments, its platform
overgrown with weeds.  From its top we could look down on
the margin of beach, loaded with bowlders, and the ruins
of what had been a jetty enclosing a little harbor for the
Imperial pleasure galleys.
</p>

<p>
"It would not be difficult to climb up here," I said
idly, pointing to the gaps between the stones, and the
sloping piles of bowlders.  "Does he suspect us, Nikka?"
</p>

<p>
"No, that is only his Gypsy caution.  He thinks we are
too good to be true.  He needed what we seem to be&mdash;and
behold, we arrive!  He has waited long.  He feels he can
wait a little longer."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid he may wait a little too long for us," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"There's a chance," Nikka admitted after a moment's
reflection.  "But we've got to risk it.  In the meantime
you must let me do all the talking.  I'll tell everybody
you are a sulky devil, a killer whose deeds haunt him.
They'll leave you alone.  Gypsies respect temperamental
criminals.  But come along, we mustn't stay by ourselves.
We'll be suspected of considering ourselves too highly or
else having something to conceal.  We can't afford any
suspicions or even a dislike."
</p>

<p>
So we strolled over to the young men's quarters, and
while I wrapped myself in a gloomy atmosphere that I
considered was typical of a temperamental killer, Nikka
swapped anecdotes of crime with the others who drifted in
and out.  I looked for Kara, but she was nowhere in
view.  After Nikka had once established my character,
the Gypsies gave me a wide berth, and I had nothing to
do but smoke and appear murderous.  And I must say I
got sick of the part.  I was the first man up when Mother
Kathene swung the stew-pot out of the chimney and old
Zitzi and Lilli began to distribute tin plates and cups in
an irregular circle on the floor.  It was poor food, but
plenty, and anyway, it broke the monotony of being an
abandoned criminal.
</p>

<p>
With the passing of the twilight the young men moved to
the courtyard.  In the middle of the open space was a
black smirch on the paving, and here they built a fire of
driftwood collected from the beach under the wall.  It
was a tribute to the immemorial habits of their race.  Even
here in the crowded city they must close the day with a
discussion of its events around a tribal blaze, exactly as
they would have done upon the road, exactly as thousands
of other Gypsy tribes were doing at that very moment
on the slopes of the Caucasus, in the recesses of the Kilo
Dagh, in the pine forests of the Carpathians, on the alien
flanks of the Appalachians far across the sea.
</p>

<p>
A buzz of talk arose.  The primitive Gypsy fiddles and
guitars began to twang softly.  Nikka was the center of
a gossiping group.  Men and women from the opposite
side of the court joined the circle.  Young girls, with the
lithe grace of the Gypsy, as unselfconscious as animals,
sifted through the ranks of the bachelors.  Beran
Tokalji, himself, a cigarette drooping sardonically from
the corner of his mouth, stalked out and sat down with
Nikka.
</p>

<p>
In the changing shadows beyond the range of the
firelight children dodged and played unhindered by their
elders.  High overhead the stars shone like fireflies under
a purple vault.  And from the spreading mass of
Stamboul echoed a gentle hum, the hum of a giant hive, a
myriad voices talking, singing, praying, laughing,
shouting, cursing, screaming.  None of the discordant night
noises of the West.  No whistle-blasts, no shrieking of flat
wheels on tortured rails, no honking of motor-horns, no
clamor of machinery.  Only the drone of the hive.
</p>

<p>
A man raised his voice in a song, and the exultantly
melancholy pæan to beauty blended with the other sounds
like a skillfully woven thread in a tapestry.  It died away
so gradually as to seem as if it had never been.  The fiddles
sighed to silence in a burst of expiring passion.
</p>

<p>
Nobody spoke for several moments.  Music was bred in
the bone of these wild folk.  It held them as could
nothing else.
</p>

<p>
"What of Giorgi Bordu?" said Tokalji presently.
"Does he sing or play or dance?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka reached out his hand almost eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I will play, if you wish.  I vowed not to touch the
fiddle again, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His fingers closed lovingly on the crude instrument, and
he cuddled it under his chin.  His bow swept the strings
in a torrent of arpeggios.  He stood up and strode into the
firelight as if upon a stage.  And then he began to play,
plaintively, at first, in a minor key.  There were the noises
of the night, a crackling fire, animals stirring, the cry of a
child, awakening.  The music brightened, quickened,
became joyous.  You felt the rays of the sun, and comfort
of work.  Men and women danced and sang.  A harsh note
intervened.  There was a quarrel.  Anger yelled from the
strings.  Turmoil ensued.  Faster and faster went the
tune.  And then peace, and the measure became slower,
almost stately.
</p>

<p>
The caravan had passed on.  A forest encompassed it.
Boughs clashed overhead, birds twittered and sang.  Cool
shadows fell athwart the path.  But the way grew steep.
The music told of the rocks and the slippery mud where
a stream had overflowed, of the steady climb, of the
endurance required.  The caravan reached the height.  A
chill wind blew, but fair before them stretched a
pleasant land, and the descent was easy to the warm, brown
road that wound across the plain.  Sunset and camp again,
firelight, the moon overhead, talk of love, the sensuous
movement of a dance.  Then, languorous and slow, the coming
of sleep.
</p>

<p>
I did not know it, but I was listening to the composition
of Zaranko's Gypsy Sonata Op. 27, which some day,
I suppose, will be as famous as the Revolutionary Etude or
the Hungarian Rhapsody or Beethoven's dream of the
moonlight.  But no audience will ever hear it with greater
appreciation than those ragged Gypsies who sat around the
fire in the dirty courtyard of the house in Sokaki Masyeri.
As Nikka resumed his place in the outer circle, only the
whispering of the flames broke the stillness.  The very
children were frozen on their knees, drunk with the ecstasy
of melody.
</p>

<p>
"Heh!" called Beran Tokalji, first to shake off the spell.
"I do not wonder you vowed not to touch the fiddle, if
you like the open road.  With that bow of yours, Giorgi
Bordu, you could wring hundreds of gold pieces from the
Franks.  You play like the Redcoats in the khans in
Buda and Bucharest.  Heh-heh! I have heard Niketu and
Stoyan Mirko and Karaji, and they were not to be compared
with you.  It is seldom the bravest men have the touch of
the fiddler."
</p>

<p>
Others spoke up readily in praise or asked questions as
to Nikka's opinion on moot points of harmony and the
desirable methods of interpreting various Gipsy songs.
They would have had him play again, but he refused.  I
think he was emotionally exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"We have no fiddler to match with you," remarked
Tokalji, "and the gaida[<a id="chap17fn1text"></a><a href="#chap17fn1">1</a>] and the flute are not fit for real
music.  But our maidens can dance.  Heh, girls, come
out, shy ones! Let the strangers view your grace."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap17fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap17fn1text">1</a>] Bagpipes.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
They giggled amongst themselves, and swayed into a
group that was as spontaneously instinct with rhythm as
an old Greek temple frieze.  But suddenly they split apart.
</p>

<p>
"Kara will dance," they cried.  "Let Kara dance for
the strangers."
</p>

<p>
And Kara floated into the circle of firelight like a spirit
of the forest.  She still wore only the scanty madder-red
skirt and torn bodice.  The cloud of her hair tumbled
below her waist.  Her tiny naked feet barely touched the
ground.  Slowly she whirled, and the Gipsy fiddles caught
her time.  A man with cymbals clashed an accompaniment.
A flute whistled soprano.  She increased the tempo; she
varied her steps.  She was a flower shrinking beneath the
grass.  She was a dove pursued by a falcon.  She was
a maiden deserted by her lover.  She was a fairy
hovering above the world.
</p>

<p>
We who watched her were breathless with the joy of the
spectacle, and when she sank to the ground in a little pile
of rags and hair as the music ended, I thought she must
be worn out.  But she bounded up at once, breathing
regularly, radiating vitality.
</p>

<p>
"Now I will dance the Knife Dance!" she exclaimed.
"Who will dance with me?"  And before any could
answer her, she seized a blazing stick from the fire, and ran
around the circle waving it overhead until she came to
where Nikka sat.  "Ho, Giorgi Bordu, you who do not
fear the knife, will you dance the Knife Dance with me?"
</p>

<p>
Every eye in the circle was fixed on Nikka, for, although
I did not know it then, to have refused her invitation would
have been a deadly insult, equivalent to a declaration of
enmity toward her family and tribe.  Similarly, acceptance
of it amounted to an admission that he considered her
favorably as a wife, without definitely committing him to
matrimony.
</p>

<p>
Nikka did not hesitate.  He stepped to her side.  She
slipped one arm around his waist, and with the other
swung her torch in air until it showered sparks over the
circle.
</p>

<p>
"Hi!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Hi!" echoed Nikka.
</p>

<p>
And they pranced around the fire while the music
commenced an air so fiercely wild that it made the blood
tingle to listen to it.  Then she flung down her torch, and
tore free from Nikka's arm.  He followed her.  She eluded
him.  Bound and round they tore, keeping step the while.
Now she accepted him, now she rejected him.  At last
he turned from her, arms folded, contemptuously unmoved.
She wooed him with rhythmic ardor.  He denied her.
She drew her knife; he drew his.  Eyes glaring, lips
pinched, they circled one another, feinting, striking,
leaping, posturing.
</p>

<p>
"Click!"  The blades struck together.
</p>

<p>
"Hi! Hi!" they cried.
</p>

<p>
"Click!  Clack!  Click!" went the knife-blades.
</p>

<p>
"Ho!  Ho!" they shouted.
</p>

<p>
The game was to see how near you could come without
cutting.  To avoid hurt the dancers required quick eyes
and agile bodies.  The blades flashed like meteors in the
shifting light, wheeling and slashing and stabbing.  In
the beginning Kara forced the pace.  Nikka retired before
her, rather than risk doing her harm.  But slowly he
assumed the mastery.  His knife was always at her throat,
and active as she was, he refused to be shaken off.  She
fended desperately, panting now, bright-eyed and flushed.
But he pressed her.  Their blades clashed, he gave his a
twist and hers dropped from her hand.
</p>

<p>
He seized her, forcing her back across his knee, knife
up-raised to strike, while the fiddles clutched at one's
nerves and the cymbals clanged with wicked glee.  The
scene&mdash;Nikka's tall figure, with the poised knife, and the
lithe, slender form he held, expressing in every curve and
line its tempestuous, untamed soul&mdash;brought to my memory
the song I had heard him sing one morning in the
music-room at Chesby:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And best of all, I shall hear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild, mad Tzigane songs,<br />
  Cruel and gay and lustful,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like fiddles and clanging gongs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And in the glare of the campfires<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall see the Tziganes dance&mdash;<br />
  Women with lithe, round bodies,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men straight as a heiduck's lance.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And perhaps a wild brown maiden<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will seek me&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Crash! boomed a knock on the street-door.  And
rap-rap-rap! it was repeated.  Crash! again.
</p>

<p>
The music stopped.  Nikka released his partner, and
Kara stooped quickly and snatched up her knife, tossing
the hair out of her eyes, heedless as usual of the rags that
slipped off her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Men looked at each other uncertainly.  Hands crept to
waist-sashes.
</p>

<p>
"Heh!" said Tokalji.  "Who can it be in such a hurry
at this hour?"'
</p>

<p>
Crash!  The door resounded under the battering of a
pistol-butt.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
THE BIG SHOW BEGINS
</h3>

<p>
The women and children&mdash;all save Kara&mdash;withdrew
into the shadows.  The men gathered together.
Tokalji crossed to the entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Less noise there!" he shouted threateningly.  "This
is a peaceful house."
</p>

<p>
But his manner changed the moment he opened the
wicket.  What he said we could not hear, but we saw him
quickly turn the lock and throw back a leaf of the door,
salaaming low as he stepped aside.  Six men burst in, four
of them in European clothes, and Nikka and I exchanged
a glance of apprehension as we recognized the broad
shoulders of their leader and heard his snarling voice.
</p>

<p>
Toutou LaFitte had arrived.  With him were Hilyer,
Serge Vassilievich and Hilmi Bey.  The two who brought
up the rear, somewhat sulky and fearful, were the spies we
had seen in front of the Pera Palace that morning.
</p>

<p>
"Can I trust nobody to fulfill my orders?" whined
Toutou, striding toward the fire.  "I tell you to spare no
efforts&mdash;and I come to find you singing and dancing around
a fire!  Is that working?  Is that carrying out our treaty?
But all are the same!  My best people fail me."
</p>

<p>
His green eyes shone evilly; his hands writhed with
suppressed ferocity.  Tokalji, having refastened the door,
followed him across the courtyard.  The Gypsy looked
uncomfortable, but showed no fear.
</p>

<p>
"What could we have done that we have not done?"
he retorted.  "Was it our fault that you lost track of the
two missing ones?  As for the English lord and his
servant, my two men that I see with you have shadowed them
day and night."
</p>

<p>
"And lost them to-day, as they admit," snarled Toutou.
"Lost them for a whole day!   Who knows what has been
accomplished in that time?"
</p>

<p>
"You are right there," agreed Tokalji coolly, "and I
have just picked two new men to take their places.  Zlacho
and Petko are good enough for ordinary thievery, but this
job seems to be above them."
</p>

<p>
"That is well," said Toutou, partly mollified.  "There
must be a change in our methods or we shall fail in this
coup.  I decided to hasten on to Constantinople with my
colleagues because I was sure the two who have escaped us
must come here sooner or later, and whenever they come
we shall find them.  But I cannot do everything.  It is
for you to follow their trails."
</p>

<p>
"Never fear!  We shall," replied Tokalji.  "My new
men start out at once.  One of them is a Frank like
yourself; the other is a Tzigane."
</p>

<p>
"Ha; let me see that Frank," exclaimed Toutou.  "I
know many of the Franks who live with the Tziganes."
</p>

<p>
"Step out, Giorgi Bordu and Jakka," called Tokalji.
</p>

<p>
Nikka sunk his fingers in my arm in a warning grip,
and we stepped forth from the group of Tziganes clustered
in front of the fire.  There was at least a chance that
we should not be identified&mdash;but its value was demonstrated
the instant the firelight splashed over Nikka's aquiline
face and tense, febrile body.
</p>

<p>
"Surely, I have seen that lean fellow before," piped
Hilmi Bey, pointing at Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"I saw them standing near the Frank lord and his
servant in Pera this morning," said one of the spies.
</p>

<p>
"What of that?" shouted Tokalji angrily.  "It is true
they followed the Franks&mdash;which was more than you could
do, Petko&mdash;and robbed them."
</p>

<p>
"No, the Franks followed them," protested Zlacho, the
other spy.
</p>

<p>
"You lie, you dog!" bellowed Tokalji.  "You think to
discredit them because they will do the work you bungled."
</p>

<p>
Vassilievich pushed in front of the newcomers.
</p>

<p>
"Is it my imagination," he inquired softly, "or does
the stocky one bear a resemblance to the Americansky,
Nash?"
</p>

<p>
"By jove, I think you're right!" exclaimed Hilyer,
speaking for the first time.
</p>

<p>
"Be ready," hissed Nikka from the corner of his mouth,
without shifting his eyes from our enemies.
</p>

<p>
His right hand was thrust into his waist-sash.
</p>

<p>
"I do not like this business," rasped Toutou, pulling a
knife from inside his vest.  "Somebody shall be tortured
until he tells the truth."
</p>

<p>
I felt a pressure between Nikka and myself, and Kara's
voice whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Run, you fools!  To the House of the Married!"
</p>

<p>
Nikka's pistol flashed blue in the firelight.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot, Jack!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
A ruddy flame jetted from his muzzle, and the spy Petko
dropped dead.  Toutou LaFitte pushed Zlacho in the line
of fire before himself, and dived into the encircling shadows
as Zlacho crumpled up with a broken leg.  Tokalji, Hilyer,
Vassilievich and Hilmi scattered.  I swung on my heel
and shot twice over the group of Gypsies by the fire.  I
could not bring myself to shoot at them, for there were
women and children close by.  Then a bullet whistled past
my ear, and Toutou's voice whined:
</p>

<p>
"No shooting! Use your knives! Take them alive!"
</p>

<p>
I had a fleeting glimpse of Kara, running at me with her
knife raised.
</p>

<p>
"There are only two!" roared Tokalji.  "Pull them
down!"
</p>

<p>
"Run!" I heard Nikka shout.
</p>

<p>
We pelted for the house on our left, the House of the
Married, as Kara had called it.  Despite Toutou's warning,
a second bullet spattered on the stones between Nikka and
me; but we were poor marks in the half-light, with people
running in every direction, many of them uncertain who
were friends or foes.  I turned as I ran, and fired into the
ground in front of Kara, who was the closest of our
pursuers; but she refused to be frightened and actually
plunged through the doorway on our heels.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tend to her," panted Nikka.  "You fasten the
door, Jack."
</p>

<p>
There was a wooden bar, which I dropped into place, and
the next minute the framework groaned under a weight
of bodies.
</p>

<p>
"No shooting," yelled Tokalji.  "You fools, you'll have
the Frank police in here!"
</p>

<p>
"One hundred Napoleons a head for them," barked
Toutou.  "Dead or alive."
</p>

<p>
The uproar redoubled, and then Tokalji evidently
invaded the throng hammering at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Leave that door alone," he snapped.  "You're wasting
time.  Go through the windows."
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Nikka," I urged.  "We can't guard every
point.  We must run for it."
</p>

<p>
"But what about this?" demanded Nikka whimsically.
He jerked his pistol muzzle at Kara sitting demurely on
the floor, playing with her knife.  "If we show our backs,
she'll knife us or open the door&mdash;and besides, where shall
we go?"
</p>

<p>
"Tie her up," I answered impatiently.
</p>

<p>
Kara, who, of course, could not understand a word of
what we were saying, laughed with glee.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I am your enemy?" she demanded in the
Tzigane dialect.  "I tell you I am your friend.  See!"
</p>

<p>
And she tossed her knife across the room.
</p>

<p>
"I came with you to help you, Giorgi Bordu."
</p>

<p>
"My name is Nikka Zaranko," he answered shortly.
</p>

<p>
"What matters your name?"  She leaped up and flung
her arms around his neck.  "It is you I love&mdash;not your
name."
</p>

<p>
Nikka eyed me sheepishly across her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"See you, little one," he remonstrated, "this is no time
for talking of love.  We may be dead in five minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she said, releasing him, nevertheless, "you
shall be off and away.  I, Kara&mdash;" and it was ridiculous
how she strutted in the manner of Tokalji, himself&mdash;"will
set you free&mdash;because I love you."
</p>

<p>
"But I am the enemy of your tribe&mdash;your enemy,"
replied Nikka.  "You do not realize what you do."
</p>

<p>
"I care not who you are," she insisted.  "I love you.
I care that for the tribe!"
</p>

<p>
She snapped her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"But come," she added as a crash sounded outside.
"They have broken in a window.  Follow me."
</p>

<p>
She led us into an adjoining room, where in the
thickness of the wall a narrow stairway corkscrewed upward,
debouching on the upper floor.  Here was a long hall,
with rooms opening off it, their windows usually on the
inner courtyard, the Garden of the Cedars of the First
Hugh's Instructions.  She turned to the right, and
entered one of the rooms.  A ladder leaned against the wall
below a trap-door in the roof.  In a corner stood a bedstead,
which she stripped of its clothes, revealing the cords
that served for springs.
</p>

<p>
"Cut those with your knife," she said.  "When we take
to the roofs we will need them to help us down again."
</p>

<p>
Nikka did as she directed, while I shut the door, and
piled the few articles of furniture against it.  Tokalji's
men were in full cry downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"There is more than enough rope here," said Nikka,
coiling it on his arm.  "Some of it I am going to use for
you."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
Passion dawned in her big eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot go with us, little one.  We have no place
to take you.  And you do not know me.  To-morrow you
would cry your eyes out."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I love you," she answered proudly.  "I,
Kara Tokalji."
</p>

<p>
"The daughter of my deadly enemy," reiterated Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he is not my father," she said lightly.  "No, I
think I will go with you, Nikka."
</p>

<p>
"And I think you won't," retorted Nikka, gritting his
teeth.  "Here, Jack, catch hold."
</p>

<p>
He cut the rope in two, gave me half, and with the
remaining section, approached her.  She backed away from
him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to hurt you," pleaded Nikka.  "But I
must bind you so they will not suspect that you aided us.
Don't you see?  And we could not run so fast with you."
</p>

<p>
"I can run as fast as the Frank," she declared.
"But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Our enemies will be here in a moment," warned Nikka.
</p>

<p>
She extended her hands, wrists joined together.
</p>

<p>
"Bind me," she said wearily.  "I love you, Nikka
Zaranko.  If I can help you in no other way, then, I will
help you by staying here."
</p>

<p>
He bound her gently, hand and foot, without a word,
and laid her on the floor by the bed.  I ascended the
ladder, and pushed back the trapdoor.
</p>

<p>
"You will come again?" she asked, looking up at him
with mournful eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If I do, it will be as an enemy," he returned.
</p>

<p>
"Your enemies are my enemies," she cried, struggling
to a sitting position.  "With a woman it is her man who
counts.  She cares nothing for the tribe&mdash;unless it be her
man's.  Now, you are my man, Nikka Zaranko."
</p>

<p>
Nikka stooped over her, and I scrambled up on the roof.
I believe he kissed her.  I heard his feet on the
ladder-rungs, and his voice calling back:
</p>

<p>
"You are a brave girl.  We will talk about this some
other time, if the stars are kind."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we shall meet again," she replied, her cords
creaking as she dropped flat on the floor.  "I am as sure of it
as if Mother Kathene had told me when the sight was on
her."
</p>

<p>
To me he merely said:
</p>

<p>
"Hurry, Jack!  We've lost too much time.  Which way?"
</p>

<p>
But I reached down first, and hauled up the ladder.
The door was shaking under a shower of blows.  Kara
looked interested as my arm appeared, and her lips shaped
themselves for a kiss.  Then she saw it was I, and
scowled.
</p>

<p>
"Next house," I panted, and we set off across the roof.
</p>

<p>
To our left was the inner courtyard, a well of darkness
in which tinkled the Fountain of the Lion.  To our right
lay Sokaki Masyeri.  Ahead was a drop of ten feet on to
the adjoining roof, the difference in height representing
the declining slope of the ground.  We made it without
any difficulty.  The people in this house had been aroused
by the shooting, and we could hear their voices and
movements.  But we shuffled on cautiously, until we came to
their courtyard, which ran clear from the street-front to
the old sea-wall.
</p>

<p>
"No choice," grunted Nikka.  "Here's a chimney.
Knot your rope.  It can't be more than twenty-five feet
to the ground.'
</p>

<p>
"Why not slide directly into the street?" I argued.
</p>

<p>
"They might catch us coming down.  Do as I say, and
we can make sure whether the coast is clear before we leave
the courtyard."
</p>

<p>
He went down first, and I followed him, scorching my
hands, for the rope was thin and had no knots to check one's
descent.  I was in mid-air when I heard an exclamation
beneath me, and a thud.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil&mdash;" I started to whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Hsst!" came from Nikka.  "Don't say anything."
</p>

<p>
He was standing over an inert figure lying on the ground
beside a half-opened door.
</p>

<p>
"Did you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, only belted him over the head with my pistol."
</p>

<p>
A woman's voice sounded inside the house, aggressively
inquisitive.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" breathed Nikka.  "She'll be out in a minute,
and I can't hit her.  We've got to try the street."
</p>

<p>
We stole through the courtyard to the street-door.
Behind us Toutou's house was seething with activity.
Somebody, apparently, had just gained the roof.  The woman
inside the house we had invaded became impatient, and a
light showed.  My fingers fumbled for the latch; it seemed
to me I should never find it.  The light wavered into the
doorway, and a scream rose shrilly.
</p>

<p>
"Let me try," said Nikka.  "Here it is!"
</p>

<p>
He pulled the door toward us very slowly, and we peered
into the street.  Not a figure showed in the direction of
Tokalji's house.  Ahead of us only a kerosene lantern
burned in front of a coffee-shop on the corner where Sokaki
Masyeri curved to the north.  And the woman in the
doorway of the house behind us was shrieking for dear life.
</p>

<p>
We sped out into the street, letting the door slam
behind us.  The noise distracted the attention of the woman
from her unconscious husband, and she left him to run
after us.  We also made the mistake of taking the middle
of the way instead of sticking to the shadows under the
walls.  And we had not gone fifty feet when we were seen
by Gypsies on the roof of Tokalji's house, and they, with
the woman to help them, cried the rest of the pack hot on
our trail.
</p>

<p>
At the corner by the coffee-shop I looked back and
counted six in a tapering string, with more emerging from
the courtyard or climbing over the roofs.  Luckily for us,
however, there was a four-way crossing a hundred yards
beyond the coffee-shop, and Nikka turned left, away from
Pera, toward which they would expect us to head.  We
would have been safe then if we had not blundered into
a Turkish gendarme.  He was naturally suspicious of our
haste, and blocked the narrow way; but I gave him a
terrific punch in his fat stomach before he could pull his
gun.
</p>

<p>
We got by, of course, but his roars put the Tziganes
right, and they followed the scent instead of losing it as
we reckoned they would.  The only thing for Nikka to
do in the circumstances was to twist and turn without
heed to direction and lose both pursuers and ourselves in
the breakneck purlieus of Stamboul.  He succeeded in shaking
off the Gypsies finally, but we were hopelessly astray,
and it was past midnight when we found the Khan of the
Georgians and staggered through the gate to thread a
precarious path between sleeping men, camels, bullocks, asses
and horses.
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali awakened with the first knock on his door,
and admitted us.  Smoking cigarette after cigarette as
rapidly as he could roll them, he listened to the story of
our adventures with avidity,&mdash;although I discovered later
that Nikka had suppressed Kara's part&mdash;and immediately
dispatched his young men to spy around Tokalji's house,
and learn the dispositions the enemy were taking.  Then
he insisted that we should sleep while he kept watch, and
the last memory I have of that awful night is of the old
Gypsy's figure stretched out on the floor, his back against
the bolted door and a cigarette in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
When we awakened the sun was streaming in through
the open door along with all the noises of the Khan and
many of its smells.  Our guardian had coffee ready for
us in a pot on the brazier, and his young men had sent
in a report.  The women and children had left Tokalji's
house under escort of several of the men shortly after
dawn.  A vigilant guard was being maintained on the
entrance, and nobody had come or gone&mdash;aside from the
party of women and children&mdash;since observation had been
established.  Before sunrise our spies had heard the sounds
of digging inside the premises.
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali looked doubtful as he imparted this last
information.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they, too, have discovered the location of the
treasure," he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Nikka, smiling.  "They are burying their
dead."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, that is a good thought to hold in the mind,"
exclaimed the old Gypsy, immensely pleased.  "What
better pleasure could a man ask than to contemplate his
enemies burying their brother that he slew!"
</p>

<p>
But instead of indulging in this Tzigane pastime we
decided to take our European clothing and adjourn to a
neighboring Turkish bath where we could remove the
evidence of our Gypsy life.  Wasso Mikali went with us to
carry back to the khan our discarded Gipsy costumes.  I
urged him to join us in the pool after we had soaked off
the top layer of iniquities in a private room; but he shook
his head with a grimace of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Tell Jakka, O son of my sister," he said, "that I
marvel at the way you risk your naked skins.  How can a man
hope to withstand the cold and heat if he has nothing but
clothing to cover him?  Too much water is bad for the
strongest.  It weakens the muscles."

CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
FIRST CRUISE OF THE CURLEW
</h3>

<p>
"So far, Jack, you and Mr. Zaranko seem to have
had most of the fun," pronounced my cousin
Betty, as we sat at luncheon in the Kings' private
sittingroom in the Pera Palace.
</p>

<p>
Watkins for the moment acted as butler, and we were
safe from inquisitive ears and could talk with freedom.
</p>

<p>
"What interests me," said Hugh thoughtfully, "is how
many of those Johnnies you scragged last night."
</p>

<p>
"Only the one, I think," replied Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"You hit another chap," I reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but two off their strength doesn't mean any great
reduction in their fighting force."
</p>

<p>
"Still, counting in those two and the men they sent off
with their women, as Nikka's pals reported, they'll be a
good bit weaker than they were," argued Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Just the same," insisted Betty, "we ought not to
run any unnecessary risks."
</p>

<p>
"Who's we?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Jack," she flashed, "because you're my
cousin is no reason why you can bully me.  You might
as well understand that I am in this, and I am going to
have my part in whatever we do."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear," Hugh applauded servilely.
</p>

<p>
Nikka laughed.
</p>

<p>
"How about it, Vernon?" I demanded of my uncle.
</p>

<p>
He spread his hands in a gesture of depreciation.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Jack," he said, "you evidently have small
acquaintance with the younger feminine generation.  Betty
is of legal age&mdash;I trust, my dear, you have no objection
to the revelation of an intimate detail your sex are
supposed to cherish in secret?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not a particle, dad," Betty responded cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and within reasonable limits, her judgment is to be
depended upon.  Moreover, a not unimportant consideration
is that she knows how to run a motor, and in our
excursions in the <i>Curlew</i> her aid has been of some value.",
</p>

<p>
"Don't be stuffy, Jack," urged Hugh.  "Give the girl
a chance.  There are lots of things she can do, short of
mixing it with your friend Toutou.  I gather that Nikka's
lady friend in the hostile camp was not averse&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That's a different matter," I interrupted, perceiving
the embarrassment on Nikka's face.
</p>

<p>
We had slurred over Kara's personal interest in his
fortunes, but even so, the incident, to quote Betty's
analysis, was "romantic to the nth degree."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that it is," asserted Betty stubbornly, "and
I intend to play my part.  You are short-handed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You forget that Nikka has seven men hidden away in
Stamboul," I reminded her.
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I take them into account," she retorted.
"But you have all been saying that it is advisable
not to use them, except in a final emergency."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," agreed Nikka.  "The more we bring
into this row, the noisier it will become.  Also, as we
decided before, we ought to have an ace or two in the hole.
Take my advice, and hang on to Wasso Mikali and his
young men to the last."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not disputing you," said Betty, still belligerent.
"What you say is only what I've been saying.  But would
you mind telling me why you are so set against using your
Gypsies?"
</p>

<p>
"If we use them there will be killing on a big scale,"
said Nikka succinctly.   "That sort of thing is bound to
become known."
</p>

<p>
"I met Riley-Gratton, the O.C. of the M.P.s this
morning, and he gave me a wad of town gossip," cut in
Hugh, "but he didn't say anything about our lads' scrap
at Tokalji's house."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we can get away with it once or maybe twice,"
returned Nikka, "but if we keep it up we'll run into
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"No question of it," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Then what are we arguing about?"' demanded Betty.
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Darn it all," I confessed. "You won't let up, will
you?  Well, have it your own way. What do you want to
do?"
</p>

<p>
"Run you down the Bosphorus after dark for a look at
Tokalji's house from the water side," she answered
promptly.
</p>

<p>
Hugh intervened.
</p>

<p>
"There's no question in the minds of you two chaps but
that any attack ought to come from the water front, is
there?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It couldn't very well come from the street," replied
Nikka. "There's a high, windowless wall and a strong
door, and even in that lawless quarter publicity would
attend an armed invasion of private property."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Betty, her head in the air, "it
couldn't be any other way. Now tell us some more about
the hiding-place of the treasure."
</p>

<p>
Nikka shrugged his shoulders and looked at me.
</p>

<p>
"What more can we say?" I answered. "There's the
courtyard and the red stone."
</p>

<p>
"It's not hollow, you said?" spoke up King.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"That would indicate a task of some difficulty in prying
loose the covering of the treasure chamber," he remarked.
"We have&mdash;or rather, I should say, Betty has&mdash;taken
precautions to install on board the <i>Curlew</i> an equipment of
crowbars, pick-axes, shovels, chisels and other tools&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and a knotted rope with a grapnel on the end to help
in going up the sea-wall," reminded Betty.
</p>

<p>
"True, my dear.  Your forethought has been admirable.
What I was about to say, however, was that a certain
amount of time&mdash;I fear, perhaps, an inordinate amount of
time&mdash;will be required to pry loose the covering of the
vault.  How are we to secure ourselves such an opportunity?"
</p>

<p>
"By choosing a time when the occupants of the house
are off-watch and their numbers diminished," declared
Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"True," agreed Nikka, "yet I confess I don't see how&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And to make a long story short we hashed it over all
afternoon until tea-time, without arriving at any clearer
view of the outlook before us.  By that time we were sick
of the discussion, and voted to suspend.  Vernon King
and Betty went to a reception at the British High
Commissioner's, and the rest of us planned to take a walk on the
chance of running into Wasso Mikali, who had promised to
come over to Pera in the afternoon if his spies picked up
any additional information.
</p>

<p>
The first person we saw in the hotel lobby was Montey
Hilyer.  He hailed us in front of the booking-office.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Chesby," he drawled in tones that reached all
the bystanders, "I don't know what sort of a lark you
fellows were up to last night, but really, you know, you
can't take liberties with natives in the East&mdash;and especially,
with their women.  Really, old chap, you ought to be
careful.  In your place, I think I'd clear out of
Constantinople.  No knowing what kind of trouble you may get
into."
</p>

<p>
Hugh was furious.  He looked Hilyer up and down with
cold scorn.
</p>

<p>
"Are you taking a flyer in blackmail, by any chance?"
he asked deliberately.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," answered Hilyer cheerfully.  "No knowing,
though.  Matter of fact, at present, I'm protecting some
poor natives who fear they are going to be victimized by a
gang of foreigners."
</p>

<p>
"Well, whatever you are doing, I should prefer that you
keep away from me in the future," said Hugh.  "I can't
afford to have the Jockey Club stewards hear that I've
been talking to you."
</p>

<p>
As it happened, the one episode in Hilyer's piebald
past that irked his pride and aroused sore memories was
his suspension from the privileges of the turf.  He was
cynically indifferent to every other charge brought against
him.  But the man was a sincere horseman, his racing
ventures had been the breath of life to him, his disgrace
and compulsion to enter his thoroughbreds under other
men's colors had been a bitter blow.  And he showed this
feeling now.  His face went dead-white; his nostrils
pinched in.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Chesby," he said curtly, "I won't forget
that."
</p>

<p>
And he disappeared into the bar.
</p>

<p>
"Curse the rotter," muttered Hugh.  "I'm glad
something will flick him on the raw."
</p>

<p>
"You were hard on him," said Nikka seriously.  "After
all, why should you mind anything that he can say?"
</p>

<p>
"He was hoping that Miss King was within hearing
distance," retorted Hugh.  "He said what he did
deliberately to smear smut on all of us.  A dog like that
doesn't deserve consideration."
</p>

<p>
"Some people believe a dog does deserve consideration,
Lord Chesby," said a feminine voice behind us.
</p>

<p>
We turned to face Hélène de Cespedes.  The Countess
Sandra Vassilievna was with her.  Maude Hilyer, her
face as ghastly as her husband's, was hurrying away from
them.
</p>

<p>
"You may be enemies, but why should you make a
woman cry?" added the Russian girl.  "She will be
unhappy for the rest of the day."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry," answered Hugh stiffly, "but do you
sincerely believe that her husband is entitled to insult me
in public?"
</p>

<p>
"It was a rotten thing he said," admitted Hélène frankly.
"And of course, he is a rotter.  But as I told you boys
once, they are a queer pair, and Maudey&mdash;well, she really
thinks that if they ever get to a state of affluence, they
can both turn around and live straight.  It's damned
silly, but&mdash;do you believe in fairies?  Those who don't,
generally envy those who do."
</p>

<p>
"We don't believe in fairies," I answered good-temperedly,
"and we also don't believe in letting a man who
is a thief get away with a gratuitous insult."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're right," said Sandra Vassilievna impartially,
"from your own point of view.  But I'm going up
to tell Maudey that she'll only ruin her complexion if she
weeps for what an offensively honest man says to her."
</p>

<p>
Hélène laughed as the Russian walked off.
</p>

<p>
"Women are almost as funny as men, aren't they?"
she said.  "Oh, say, before I forget it, Mr. Nash, you want
to look out for that girl's brother.  You slammed him one
or two in that fight at Chesby, and he's had it in for you
ever since.  And after last night, all the men are wild.
If that Gypsy Tokalji catches you&mdash;phew!  Oh, boy!  And
Toutou!"
</p>

<p>
"They weren't able to catch us last night," returned
Nikka.  "They aren't likely to have as good a chance
again."
</p>

<p>
"You put up a great fight," she agreed.  "Oh, I'm
handing it to you, all of you!  You're the best little bunch
I ever ran across.  Say, I wouldn't believe an English lord
could be as much of a hustler as you, Lord Chesby.  Your
uncle, he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"What about my uncle?" asked Hugh eagerly.  "D'you
mind telling how your push got on to him?"
</p>

<p>
"N-no, I suppose there's no harm now," she answered
slowly.  "Poor old fellow!  I was darned sorry he was
croaked.  We none of us&mdash;  Well, what's the use talking?
That Toutou is a devil, Mr. Nash knows it.  I only hope
he and the rest of you don't get to know him any
better.  But about your uncle, Lord Chesby.  He was a cinch.
He ran around here like a kid in a game of
'Cops-and-thieves.'  Everybody knew he was up to something.  The
authorities thought he was just a nut.  But when he took
to snooping around Tokalji's house, our folks got wise
to it he might be on to something good.  Tokalji's tribe
have always had this tradition of a treasure&mdash;  But you
know about that.  Tokalji had been working with us since
before the War, and he realized this was more than he
could tackle by himself, so he called on Toutou.  The rest
is what's going to happen."
</p>

<p>
"And that?" asked Hugh, grinning.
</p>

<p>
"My dear young lord, you'll lose your shirt&mdash;if not
your life," she retorted airily.
</p>

<p>
"Tough luck," said Hugh, "but your people have got
to do better, in that case."
</p>

<p>
"You're dead right," she agreed.  "Say, Mr. Zaranko,
on the level now, did that girl of Tokalji's sell out to you
last night?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka stared at her blankly, his face a perfect mask.
</p>

<p>
"We had a good deal of trouble with her," he returned.
"Had to tie her up.  She was right on our heels, with her
knife."
</p>

<p>
Hélène shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es, that's true, but&mdash;I saw her this morning.
Humph!  Maybe I'm a fool.  I told Toutou to mind his
own business, and not mix into the tribe's affairs.  Tokalji
said she was all right, and that ought to be enough."
</p>

<p>
"God help Toutou if he went after her," I said facetiously.
</p>

<p>
Hélène gave me a quick glance.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you're right," she said.  "I've often wondered
what Toutou would do against a woman who used
a knife.  He&mdash;he gets 'em in a different way.  Well, I'm
babbling, which is a sign of old age.  Be good, boys, and
give up before you get into serious trouble.  As ever, your
well-wisher, Hélène."
</p>

<p>
And she tripped off.
</p>

<p>
"What a delightful criminal," I remarked.  "Somehow
I don't mind so much the idea of being plucked by her."
</p>

<p>
"You're losing your perspective," growled Hugh, who
was in a righteous frame of mind, partly because he was
in love and partly because of his clash with Hilyer.  "A
crook is a crook.  They're all against us.  I don't know
but that the women are the most dangerous where you
are concerned, Jack.  Why are you so damned susceptible?"
</p>

<p>
At which I laughed.  Nikka, walking beside us, had no
ears for our conversation.  His thoughts were on that
slim, brown Tzigane maid about whom Hélène de Cespedes
had inquired.  But he woke up a block farther on, when a
big, turbanned figure shambled past us, with a guttural
exclamation from the corner of his mouth.  At the next
corner there was a traffic block, and we grouped casually
around Wasso Mikali.
</p>

<p>
"Tokalji's women and children are in camp beyond
Boghazkeui on the edge of the Forest of Belgrade," he
murmured, staring at a fat Turkish Pasha who was
rolling by in a Daimler.  "There are five men with them.
Five other men have left Sokaki Masyeri since morning.
If Franks were there they have gone."
</p>

<p>
"It is good, my uncle," returned Nikka, affecting to
speak to Hugh.  "Continue the watch.  If there is more
to report bid one of your young men lounge before the
khan where we are staying to-morrow in the forenoon."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be done," said the old man, and he elbowed his
way through our ranks as though in haste to cross over.
</p>

<p>
I looked behind us for the inevitable spies.  There were
several Levantines in European dress and tarboosh on the
corner&mdash;and Hilmi Bey, who pretended that he was not
noticing us.  His attitude was that of scorning to spy and
hating to have it supposed that he could demean himself
to so plebeian a phase of crime.  I called a greeting to
him in derision.
</p>

<p>
"Are you walking our way?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I have a house in the Rue Midhat Pasha," he answered
effusively.  "I am going to visit my wives.  It is
a long time since I have seen them.  Don't let me detain
you, gentlemen.  I turn right at the opposite corner."
</p>

<p>
"A vain dog," commented Nikka, sourly watching
Hilmi's plump back.  "He was afraid to be caught in such
an ordinary undertaking.'
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Hugh, whose temper had improved, "it
goes to show that criminals are human beings.  Every one
of these birds seems to have some sense of shame if you
can only pick out the right point of contact."
</p>

<p>
We led our escorts&mdash;for we took it for granted that we
were under observation&mdash;a dilatory stroll, and arrived back
at the Pera Palace in time for dinner, which, as usual, we
had served in the King's sitting room.  It was a leisurely
meal, for we had time to kill.  There was an early moon,
and we wanted it to set before the <i>Curlew</i> left the Golden
Horn.
</p>

<p>
After Watkins had brought the coffee, Betty excused
herself.  She returned in a quarter of an hour dressed in a
warm sport suit instead of the light evening frock she had
worn, and carrying two boxes of cartridges.
</p>

<p>
"Have you all got your pistols loaded?" she inquired.
"Watkins?  Daddy?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so, my dear," answered her father
absent-mindedly.  "I wish, Jack, that you had observed more
carefully the carvings on that colonnade.  It may be truly
ancient or&mdash;  What?  What is it, Betty?"
</p>

<p>
She deftly frisked him, and examined his automatic.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's all right," she said, returning it to him.
"And for Heaven's sake remember, Dad, that the safety
lock is on.  Here's an extra clip.  Watkins?"
</p>

<p>
Watkins set down the tray of coffee-cups, and cautiously
hauled his weapon from his hip-pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, I think, ma'am, Miss King," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Here's an extra clip for you, too.  Boys?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't catch old campaigners like us with empty
weapons," I jeered.  "It isn't we who'll be getting into
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could be sure of that," she retorted.  "Most
likely I'll be trying to pull you out of a scrape twenty-four
hours from now.  But let's get started.  We have a
car at the side entrance to run us down to the Man-o'-war
Landing, where the <i>Curlew</i> is moored."
</p>

<p>
If the spies were still watching the hotel, as I have no
doubt they were, we gave them the slip.  We went downstairs
together, and shot into the closed car which was in
waiting, Watkins sitting beside the chauffeur.  Ten
minutes later we drew up on the <i>Curlew's</i> dock, secure from
observation because of the British marine sentries who
stood guard at the dock-gates.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Curlew</i> was a handy craft, decked over forward, with
a roomy cockpit and a good, heavy-duty Mercedes engine.
She was nothing to look at, but reliable and efficient.
Betty, who was an experienced yachtswoman, automatically
assumed command, and Hugh and Watkins as automatically
accepted the rôle of crew.  Vernon King, Nikka
and I tried to be as inconspicuous as possible.
</p>

<p>
"Lay for'ard, Hugh, and slack off that bow-line,"
ordered Betty energetically.  "How is the engine,
Watkins?  Very well, turn it over."
</p>

<p>
There was a splutter, and then the steady "put-put-put."
</p>

<p>
"Cast off that bow-line, Hugh!  Lay aft, Watkins.  Is
the stern-line slack?  Pay out!  Let go!  Get out from
under my feet, Jack.  No, Daddy, you can't have a
cigar&mdash;nothing but running-lights.  I'd douse those if I weren't
afraid of the Navy people.  Mr. Zaranko, d'you mind
dropping into the cabin and taking a look at the tools
we laid in?"
</p>

<p>
We chugged slowly through the glut of shipping in the
Golden Horn, edging away from the Galata shore toward
the picturesque bulk of Stamboul.  Seraglio Point loomed
ahead of us, high, rugged, tree-covered, dotted with
infrequent lights.  We rounded it, the lighthouse twinkling
on our starboard beam, and turned southwest into the
Bosphorus, with the wide sweep of the Marmora just ahead.
To port the outline of Scutari and the suburbs on the
Asiatic shore showed dimly.  To starboard Stamboul
towered, white and ghostly and serenely beautiful, more
than ever the magic city of the Arabian Nights.  The
steamer from Rodosto and other Marmoran ports steamed
past us with a swash and gurgle.  A belated fishing-boat
flapped by.  Then we had the waters to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
"Have you the night-glasses, Hugh?" questioned Betty.
"See if you can make out the St. Sophia minarets."  And
to us: "That's our first landfall in making Tokalji's
house.  Watkins, I think it ought to be safe now to douse
the running-lights."
</p>

<p>
Hugh leaned forward across the cabin-roof, resting on
his elbows, eyes glued to the glasses.
</p>

<p>
"Right O," he called back.  "I'm on them&mdash;and I can
see that big old tower of the sea-walls that lies this side
of the jetty."
</p>

<p>
Betty cut off the engine.
</p>

<p>
"Fetch the sweeps, Watkins," she whispered.  "We'll
pull in.  Quiet, everybody."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
OUT OF LUCK
</h3>

<p>
Hugh and Watkins unlashed two heavy oars from
the cabin roof and thrust them outboard through
oarlocks rivetted to the cockpit railing.  Side
by side, in unison, they pulled with a long, deliberate
stroke, while Betty steered.  It was no easy task to move
that launch across the swift-flowing tide of the Bosphorus,
and it seemed an endless time before the blurred mass of
the shoreline, becoming visible to our unaided sight,
furnished an index to the progress we were making.
</p>

<p>
"Nikka and I can relieve them," I offered as the rowers
began to pant.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't done it before," answered Betty shortly.
"You might splash."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the oars made scarcely a ripple as they were
lifted, feathered and dipped, tedious as was the effort
imposed both by their weight and the size of the launch.
</p>

<p>
"Much farther?" Hugh gritted between clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
"The jetty is right ahead," Betty reassured him.  "You
had better get forward, Dad, and be ready to fend off the
rocks."
</p>

<p>
Vernon King climbed up on the cabin roof and crawled
into the bow.  Nikka and I strained our eyes endeavoring
to identify the details of the shore.  To the right, and
already a little astern of us, was a huge round tower, one
of the bulwarks of the ancient walls.  Other than this
there was only a dim range of masonry, the city walls, for
the most part, crowned by houses.  Not a light showed
opposite to us.
</p>

<p>
Presently, letting our eyes drop lower, we descried
immediately in front a low breakwater, a jagged pile of rocks
that ran out from the shore in the form of a blunted hook.
Betty, steering carefully, brought the <i>Curlew</i> inside the
hook and bow-on to the shore, so that the launch was
protected from the current that flowed through the Strait.
King scrambled ashore and made fast a line around one
of the rocks, then felt his way back along the slippery
footing of the breakwater and stepped into the cockpit.  Hugh
and Watkins unshipped the sweeps and laid them on the
cabin roof.
</p>

<p>
All of us were staring at the blank darkness of the
shoreline, tense and watchful; but my uncle's interest
was still largely of an antiquarian nature.
</p>

<p>
"Do you appreciate how extraordinarily fortunate we
are to have this ruined jetty to moor to?" he whispered
excitedly.  "No galleys in the old days were ever able to
assail these seaward walls because of the currents.
Without protection, we, too, should be smashed to pieces if
we tried to lie under them.  But this place evidently was
one of the walls of a harbor for the Imperial galleys.  It
was, of course, fortified.  This hook terminated in a strong
tower.  A second hook&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Daddy, Daddy," remonstrated Betty, "you aren't
lecturing to-night.  We&mdash;we're reconnoitering the
enemy's position."
</p>

<p>
Hugh had been studying the shore again through the
night-glasses.
</p>

<p>
"Not a sign of life," he murmured.  "Now, you chaps,
show us the lay of the land."
</p>

<p>
Nikka and I, with the help of the glasses, plotted for the
others the arrangement of Tokalji's establishment.  There
was the brick extension of the bachelors' quarters, crowning
a part of the sea-wall.  There was the gap between this
structure and the House of the Married, which was shut
in only by the crenellated height of the wall.  And finally,
there was the House of the Married, with the Garden of
the Cedars concealed within its heart, lifting its solid
bulk above all adjoining buildings.  There were no
windows on the seaward face of Tokalji's house.
</p>

<p>
"The old wall between the two wings&mdash;between the
bachelors' quarters and warehouse and the House of the
Married&mdash;ought to be easy to climb," I concluded.
</p>

<p>
"The wall of the House of the Married is very irregular,
too," added Betty.  "We have passed it close in a
number of times by daylight, and we all agreed an active
man could climb it."
</p>

<p>
"That's a good idea," approved Nikka.  "If you could
enter by the House of the Married you could seize the
valuable part of the position first.  Sound military
strategy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," assented Hugh, "you could consolidate your
position&mdash;how the old lingo comes back, though!&mdash;and
then occupy the rest of the place as convenient.  By Jove,
if you didn't want to occupy it, you could&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'd have to occupy it," I interrupted.  "I say,
do you know that place looks deserted?"
</p>

<p>
"There's somebody there, never fear," rejoined Betty.
</p>

<p>
"According to Nikka's uncle, a good part of the
garrison were withdrawn to-day," returned Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"There is no use hurrying," cautioned my uncle.  "We
shall have plenty of opportunities."
</p>

<p>
"There is good reason for striking when you are not
expected," retorted Hugh.
</p>

<p>
Nobody answered him.  We were all staring hungrily at
the shadowy shape of the House of the Married, towering
above the seawall.  It hypnotized us.  We were enthralled
by the unfathomable mysteries it suggested, by the
knowledge of the mighty prize it contained.
</p>

<p>
"There's no time like the present," I said softly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they won't be looking for us so soon again," agreed
Nikka.  "They will be figuring that we had enough of a
fright last night."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you are right," surrendered Vernon King.
"Audacity, we are frequently told, is the favored bride of
fortune.  I must admit that this place exerts a lure which
arouses in me certain primitive instincts I had supposed
were finally cured or buried.'
</p>

<p>
"You mean, Dad," said Betty, "that you feel like
being foolish with the others."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come, Bet," protested Hugh, "this is no time
for squabbling.  What could be more unexpected than a
raid from us to-night?  They probably think, as Nikka
says, that we will go slow after last night, and they don't
even know we are out here."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't be too sure of that," rejoined Betty.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," I said, "their force is so depleted that we
couldn't have a better opportunity."
</p>

<p>
"They may be reinforced."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," said Hugh.  "Watty, bring out those tools.
We shall want the rope for climbing and a couple of
crowbars.  If we need anything else we can send back for
it."
</p>

<p>
Watkins, who had preserved a respectful silence throughout
our debate, cleared his throat apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your ludship's pardon, but&mdash;but&mdash;you'll not be
going into that den of thieves at this hour of the night,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Watty.  It will be easier 'at this hour of
the night' than in broad daylight."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;your ludship!  Mister Hugh, sir!  It's
flying in the face of Providence, if I may say so&mdash;after
what 'appened to Mister Jack and Mister Nikka, sir&mdash;there's
no knowing what those devils 'ave waitin' for you."
</p>

<p>
I am ashamed to say that we all chuckled as loudly as
we dared at Watkins's fears.
</p>

<p>
"You can stay in the boat with Miss Betty, if you'd
rather," said Hugh.
</p>

<p>
Without a word, Watkins dropped down the cabin hatchway.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you single me out to be left behind?"
demanded Betty indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Because, Betty, you can't climb that wall&mdash;and somebody
has got to be ready to start the engine and get us
away in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you're right," she sighed.  "Well, don't
blame me if anything goes wrong.  Of all the
hare-brained&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Rats!" I scoffed.  "If they jump us, and there are
too many of them, we'll retreat.  But maybe we can clean
up this job to-night for good and all.  If we can, it's
worth trying."
</p>

<p>
Watkins emerged from the cabin with the tools and the
expression of a martyr.  Nikka insisted that he was the
best climber in the party, and took charge of the rope.
Hugh and I carried the crowbars, which we wrapped in
sailcloth to prevent their clinking against the stones of
the wall.  Then we stepped on to the slimy rocks of the
jetty, Nikka in the lead.
</p>

<p>
It was a perilous climb to the shore, and we negotiated
it slowly, helping one another and taking every precaution
to avoid making any noise.  At last we found ourselves
in the jumble of bowlders constituting the breakwater
at the foot of the sea-wall, which reared its moss-grown
battlements high overhead.  We turned to the left
here, and crawled over and through the rocks on the beach
to a point under the overhanging wall of the House of the
Married.  From the beach it looked unclimbable, but
Nikka, after surveying its mounting courses, shattered and
riven by centuries of neglect, by earthquakes and the
ceaseless battering of the waves, removed his shoes and started
the ascent, an end of the grapnel-rope looped around his
waist.
</p>

<p>
We who watched him stood with knocking hearts for
what seemed an eternity.  Spread-eagled against the wall,
he appeared as infinitesimal as a fly in the darkness.  At
first we could see him when he slipped and caught
himself or sprawled or clutched for handholds.  But soon he
became an indistinct blotch on the masonry, and we held
our breath, helpless now to aid him.  Our first
knowledge that he had succeeded came when he jerked up the
grapnel lying on the beach at our feet.  He hoisted it
slowly, lest it clash against the wall, adjusted its prongs
and tossed down the knotted length of rope.
</p>

<p>
Hugh followed him with ease, bracing his feet against
the wall when he was tired.  Then I went up.  Then my
uncle.  Watkins came last.  We stood, bending low, on
the seaward verge of the roof over which Nikka and I had
fled the previous night.  It was now well towards midnight,
and a haze was settling over the city.  The <i>Curlew</i> was
invisible even to us who knew precisely her location.  The
large courtyard to our right was a mere blot; the
Garden of the Cedars in front of us was marked by the
whispering tops of its two trees.  The silence was
absolute.  The water lapped on the beach below.  That was
all.
</p>

<p>
Naturally and by right, Hugh took command.  It was
his expedition.
</p>

<p>
"Do we go down through the trapdoor Jack and Nikka
used or do we use the rope to drop directly into the
Garden?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Best use the trapdoor," advised Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I agreed.  "Then the rope will always be handy
in case you want to escape."
</p>

<p>
"Right O!" endorsed Hugh cheerfully.  "Jack, you
and Nikka will come with me.  Professor King and Watty
will be rearguard and second-line for emergency use.  Stay
where you are, Professor, until you hear from us."
</p>

<p>
"But do you consider it advisable, in full accord with
military strategy, to divide your forces?" objected my
uncle.  "Surely&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We can handle twice our number," replied Hugh.  "If
there are more than that we'll call on you.  But you and
Watty aren't as used to scrapping as we are, and it
wouldn't be fair to mix you in it if it can be avoided.
Come on, lads."
</p>

<p>
We crossed the roof toward Sokaki Masyeri, the large
courtyard on our right, the Garden of the Cedars on our
left.  The trapdoor was shut, but unfastened, and Hugh
lifted it.  The ladder was in place under it.  Hugh
lowered himself gently, and creaked down to the floor.  We
followed him.  The room was in pitch-darkness, but we
made certain by touch that it was empty.  The bed from
which Nikka and I had cut the cords lay exactly as we had
left it, the clothes tumbled over the foot.  The door to the
hall was off its hinges, but propped in place.
</p>

<p>
"I've picked up a chair-leg," Nikka whispered by the
broken door.  "You fellows use your crowbars if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused significantly.
</p>

<p>
"Right," Hugh whispered back.  "Can we lift this door
aside?"
</p>

<p>
The hinges rattled slightly as we shifted it.  The next
moment we peered through a yawning cavity, ears
alert.  Not a sound reached us, and we stole forward with
the utmost care.  Midway of the hall were the corkscrew
stairs up which Kara had guided Nikka and me.  I judged
we were close to them when a door jarred beside us.  There
was a shout, and we were surrounded by a mob of half-seen
figures.  They poured from the head of the stairs as
well as from the rooms opening off the hall in which they
had lain concealed.  They were all around us, but in the
darkness they got in each other's way, and I thought we
could beat them off.
</p>

<p>
A man seized me by the shoulder, and I drove my fist
into his face.  Two others leaped on me.  I cracked the
skull of one with my crowbar, and broke the arm of the
second.  Hugh in front of me was driving his opponents
down the stairs.  I heard Nikka exclaim once, then a
gasp&mdash;and a light flashed, three lights flashed.  Hugh had
cleared a space, but went down as I looked, throttled from
behind.  Nikka was just rising from beside a man whose
head was crushed in.  Then the rush began again.
</p>

<p>
I reached for my pistol, but did not have time to draw
it.  The attackers surged in from all sides.  I had a
fleeting glimpse of Hilmi Bey.  Serge Yassilievich ran up the
stair.  I heard somewhere the snarling voice of Toutou
LaFitte.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, hold them for me!" cried Nikka.  "Must warn&mdash;King!"
</p>

<p>
I swung my crowbar in a circle, and backed towards
Nikka's voice.  He had shaken himself clear.
</p>

<p>
"In that door&mdash;opposite&mdash;reach window!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
We charged and split a path toward the door of one
of the rooms.  As we reached it, a pair of gorilla-like
arms wound around my neck.  I tried to hit over my
shoulder with the crowbar, but somebody caught my wrist.
As I fell I heard Nikka's cry:
</p>

<p>
"Run, Professor!  Save Betty!  We're&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
That was all.  Toutou had me on the floor and was
choking the life out of me.  I lost consciousness.
</p>

<p>
When I came to I was lying on a very damp, hard floor.
Several lights dazzled my aching eyes, and a number of
people were talking in French.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, Nash is with us again," said Hilyer's voice.  "I
was afraid you might have done him in, Toutou."
</p>

<p>
"If you take my advice,"&mdash;I recognized Hilmi Bey's
falsetto tones&mdash;"you will have Toutou operate on all three
of them.  He has ways to make silent men speak.  Do
you remember Rattner, the Swiss broker, Toutou?"
</p>

<p>
Toutou's answer was an almost indistinguishable
"guhr-rrrr-rrr-rr" of rage.
</p>

<p>
Alive now to the position I was in, I opened my eyes
wider and tried to rise.  But I was bound hand and foot,
and could not move.  I could, however, see where I was.
Not far away Hugh and Nikka were propped against the
stone wall of a chamber, which I suppose you could call
a dungeon.  It had no window.  The one door was open.
The floor sloped gradually toward the center, where there
was a square stone grating about two feet square.
</p>

<p>
But the most interesting aspect of my surroundings was
the group in the doorway.  Toutou stood in front, his
green eyes sparkling with hate and lust.  Hilmi Bey
fawned at his elbow.  Serge Yassilievich and Hilyer were
there.  Tokalji frowned at us, hand on his knife-hilt,
Hélène de Cespedes and Sandra Vassilievna, in their
modish costumes, looked singularly out of place.  They lent
a touch of unreality to what was otherwise a singularly
brutish picture.  As I looked, Hélène stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
"Help Mr. Nash to sit up, Montey," she said.
</p>

<p>
He looked from her to Toutou.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it won't prevent his answering questions," she
snapped.  "Please do as I say."
</p>

<p>
He raised me not ungently to a sitting position.  Hugh
and Nikka grinned at me.
</p>

<p>
"The question before the house," said Hugh, "is what
route to Hades we are to take, and the preliminary stages
of discomfort we shall undergo to satisfy the head devil
over there and his assistants."
</p>

<p>
"You are in a serious fix," continued Hélène.  "Joking
won't help you any.  I've tried to make you boys
understand that the Boches were merciful enemies compared
to us.  We don't recognize civilization.  For us it doesn't
exist.  We have gone back to primal principles.  Now
we've got you, and you've got to talk."
</p>

<p>
"Words, words," lamented Hilmi viciously.  "Let Toutou
take his knife to them.  That will do the trick."
</p>

<p>
Tokalji evidently understood the purport of this, for
he rasped a quick assent.  Toutou flashed a long,
stiletto-like blade, and stepped toward us.
</p>

<p>
"I'll carve them," he purred.  "They do not look now
as they will when I have finished with them.  Ha, yes,
Toutou's knife knows the way to truth.  Soon they will
be asking to die."
</p>

<p>
But Hilyer jumped in front of him.  The Englishman's
thin face was aflame with temper.
</p>

<p>
"I'll stand for a good deal," he said, "but I won't
permit torture.  You are a fool, Toutou.  You'd only kill
them the way you did the old lord.  Here, you people,
we must call him off.  He'll spoil the whole show."
</p>

<p>
Sandra backed him up, and compelled her brother somewhat
sullenly to join in the protest.  But Hilmi Bey and
Tokalji energetically took the opposing side.
</p>

<p>
"They have killed three more of my men," howled the
Gypsy.  "Shall they sow death through my tribe, and live
unharmed?"'
</p>

<p>
"They shall," declared Hélène calmly.
</p>

<p>
She stepped beside Toutou, and placed her fingers on
his wrist.  Her eyes sought his.  He snarled in his
cat-like fashion, and drew away from her.  But she fearlessly
came closer to him, and slowly, under the compulsion of
her fingers, he returned the knife to its sheath.
</p>

<p>
"Hilmi Bey!" she rapped.
</p>

<p>
The Levantine bowed before her.
</p>

<p>
"If you spoil this play," she said coldly, "I will kill
you with my own hand.  Keep out of what concerns your
betters, pig!"
</p>

<p>
He cringed to her, and would have answered.  But she
silenced him with a wave of the hand.
</p>

<p>
"There has been enough of this," she went on.  "Mr. Nash,
do you join with your friends in refusing to give
up your secret?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she answered, "we will leave you to
think it over.  If you are wise, you will understand that
having blundered into this trap&mdash;as you must have blundered
sooner or later&mdash;the best you can hope for is life
in exchange for what we want.  I cannot continue to save
you from the cruelty of those of us who relish brutal
measures.  There is a limit to my patience, too.  I advise
you to make intelligent use of the next twenty-four hours.
You cannot be saved.  Your friends cannot reach you.
The authorities cannot intervene.  If they did, you would
disappear.  You have twenty-four hours more."
</p>

<p>
They took all the lanterns, except one, and went out,
locking the door after them.

CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
WATKINS TO THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p>
"Well, this is a nice mess I got you chaps into,"
said Hugh unhappily.
</p>

<p>
"It's not your fault any more than it is
ours," returned Nikka.  "We walked squarely into a trap
and were bagged.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
"Were they ready for us?" I asked with what interest
my aching head would permit.
</p>

<p>
Hugh laughed with hollow mirth.
</p>

<p>
"That girl Hélène has an uncanny mind.  She told the
others, when their trailers reported they had lost us, to
watch out for a raid on Tokalji's premises.  They were
so exultant over it that they blabbed everything.  They
didn't hear the <i>Curlew</i> or see her.  They didn't know we
were here until we raised the trapdoor.  But they were
prepared for us no matter which way we came.  They had
brought in every man they could trust.  We didn't have
a chance."
</p>

<p>
"Did the Kings and Watty get away?"
</p>

<p>
"Must have.  Hélène and the others said nothing about
them."
</p>

<p>
"I hope they will not try anything foolish in the way
of a rescue," said Nikka.  "If Wasso Mikali establishes
touch with them, I am afraid they may be tempted to do
something."
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing they can do," answered Hugh.  "Our
goose is cooked.  We're kaput, finished.  As Hélène said,
if the O.C. of the Forces of Occupation jammed his way
in here, they could make a clean sweep of us.  They
might&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;they might drop us down that grating in the floor,
toss us into the Bosphorus the way Abdul the Damned
used to dispose of his enemies.  There are lots of things
they could do with us.  They will think that even if they
have to scrag us they will still have the Kings and Watty
to work on."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too comforting," I observed with feeble sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
Nikka roused himself.
</p>

<p>
"There is no sense in abandoning hope," he remarked.
"Is this any worse than that pill-box at Le Ferriere?"
</p>

<p>
"Good old Nikka," said Hugh affectionately.  "I say,
if I had to make an ass of myself I'd rather do it with
two such prime&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Asses?" I suggested.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;Not even to you would I say that, Jack," he
retorted.  "By the way, lads, we're not running true to
form.  In every tale I ever read in which brave,
resourceful men were made prisoners, they gnawed each other's
ropes and so gained their freedom."
</p>

<p>
Nikka chuckled at this.
</p>

<p>
"If I tried to reach either of you I'd roll over on my
face," he said.  "I've already tested the knots around my
wrists.  It would take a strong man half an hour to
untie them, and a very sharp knife to hack through them.
The only way we shall be freed is by help from
outside."
</p>

<p>
"That means not at all," replied Hugh.  "Let's try
for a nap.  It must be some hours to daylight yet&mdash;not
that that matters any in this dark hole."
</p>

<p>
We slept fitfully, frightfully harassed by the curtailment
of circulation due to the straitness of our bonds and
the discomfort of our positions which we might not change.
Hugh fell over in his sleep, and awakened Nikka and me
with his groans as he endeavored to roll off his face.  By
persistent efforts he finally succeeded in getting on his
back; but he was obliged to stay there, and advised us
to retain our sitting positions if we could.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we had no means of estimating the passage
of time, but we figured it was well into the forenoon
when we abandoned further efforts for sleep.  Nobody
came to us, and we began to be aware of the pangs of
hunger and thirst.  At first we paid little attention to
this hardship, but as the hours dragged along we realized
that our desertion could mean only one thing: that our
enemies were determined to assail our courage with every
weapon they had.  And to tell the truth, courage became
something to grapple for after your belly turned upside
down for emptiness and your tongue commenced to thicken.
To add to our misery, the one lantern flickered out with
a rancid stench of oil, and several rats discovered us.
They feared us, perhaps, as much as we feared them.
But their scamperings and sorties were nerve-racking, and
we expected every moment to feel their sharp teeth in
our wrists and ankles.
</p>

<p>
For a while we talked and sang and told stories, but
our cracked lips and swollen tongues soon felt the strain
of vocal effort.  What the others did then I don't know,
but I fell asleep&mdash;to awaken suddenly with a gasp of
agony as I lost my balance and fell sideways, striking
my head on the stone floor.
</p>

<p>
"Too bad," came Hugh's voice from the darkness,
strangely muffled.  "Hit your head, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I moaned.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-four hours must be nearly up," croaked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
I fought for a while to work over on to my back, but
my limbs had become so stiff that I could not.  I had to
lie on my stomach, with my head resting, now on one
cheek, now on the other.  In this position, ear to the
floor, it seemed to me that I heard a clink of metal, not
outside the door of the dungeon, but somewhere underneath.
I asked the others if they heard it, but they said
no, and I could tell from their pitying tones that they
thought I was becoming delirious.
</p>

<p>
Yet again I heard it, and almost immediately afterward
a wholly different sound: footsteps approaching the
door.  The two noises persisted together until the dungeon
door was thrown open with a clatter.  I forgot all about
the first noise in the sight of Toutou LaFitte, standing by
himself in the doorway, his shirt-sleeves rolled up and a
grin of horrible anticipation distorting his beautiful face.
</p>

<p>
It was as though a mask of animal hunger cloaked his
features.  Their regularity was undisturbed.  Each was
in its usual place and relation to the rest, but their effect
was entirely abnormal.  They were warped and twisted
by passions that must have rocked the foundations of the
man's soul.  His green eyes radiated an unholy light.
His long arms were crooked and extended, his hands open
and prehensile fingers hooked.  He walked warily,
bent-kneed, slowly.  A slight trickle of saliva flowed from the
corner of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
In the doorway he stood motionless for a moment, surveying
the three of us.  Then he advanced, leaving the door
open against the wall, and unhooked the stable-lantern
which hung from his belt.  He placed this close to the
grating, and prowled over to where I lay.
</p>

<p>
I say "prowled," and I mean just that.  He walked
like a big forest cat, or, rather, like a gorilla, investigating
a likely meal awaiting the kill.  When he stood by
me, I felt up and down my spine the shiver of
apprehension, of sheer horror, that I had known before in his
proximity.  When he turned me on my back, and his
powerful hands, with their smooth fingers and polished
nails, explored my muscles, I could have screamed with
terror.  I twitched at his touch, with an involuntary
exclamation of repugnance.  He snarled, and his fingers
pressed on a nerve of the upper arm, with a force that
made me faint.
</p>

<p>
But almost at once he flung me from him, and walked
across to Hugh, who met him unflinchingly.
</p>

<p>
"I take it, Monsieur Toutou," said Hugh, "that the
twenty-four hours are up."
</p>

<p>
Toutou stood over him, with that peculiarly animal,
bent-kneed posture of meditated attack, arms flexed forward.
</p>

<p>
"Not quite," he answered in the throaty, guttural voice
that I always identified with him.  "But we are tired of
waiting."
</p>

<p>
He swooped and snatched Hugh into his arms, just as
a gorilla might, squeezing ferociously.  Hugh's face
showed above his shoulder, white and beaded with
perspiration.  I thought the fiend intended to crush Hugh's
ribs, but he ceased as suddenly as he had begun and
tossed his victim down on the floor again.
</p>

<p>
"You shall come last," he growled.  "First, you shall
see your friends suffer."
</p>

<p>
Hugh was too weak from the handling he had just experienced
and the shock of his fall to see what happened
next, but I did.  Toutou leaped on Nikka with one tigerish
spring, lifting him to his feet and propping him against
the wall.  Then he prodded Nikka from head to foot,
testing out muscles and joints, all the time growling in
his throat.  He did not hurt him, simply felt of him as
though to determine the parts of his body which would be
juiciest.
</p>

<p>
Nikka's face showed revulsion, but no fear.
</p>

<p>
"Do you eat men, Toutou?" he gibed.
</p>

<p>
Toutou flashed his knife, and I closed my eyes, thinking
to see the torture begin.  But when I opened them
again, the knife was slashing the ropes that bound Nikka's
limbs.  For a second I credited the incredible.  Were we
to be set free?  But no.  Toutou sheathed the knife, and
crouched before Nikka once more, animal-like, menacing.
</p>

<p>
"I am a bone-breaker," he rasped.  "I break men, bone
by bone, joint by joint.  Have you ever felt your bones
breaking, your sinews cracking?  Guuhhrr-rrrr-rrr-rr!"
</p>

<p>
He pounced, and Nikka screamed, screamed in an excess
of agony as the beast's fingers sank into his shoulder,
torturing the nerves, tearing the sinews and muscles,
dragging the bone from its socket.
</p>

<p>
But there was another cry from the open door.  With
a whirl of skirts a slight figure darted in, a knife gleamed
and plunged home, and Toutou started back from his
victim, his own left arm dripping blood.  His face was
a queer mixture of rage, lust and puzzled alarm.  Shaking
his head, with the saliva trickling down his chin, he
stood, frowning, like an animal more than ever, an animal
which had been curbed and chastised.  And before him,
knife in one hand, pistol in the other, stood Kara, her
eyes blazing with passion, breast heaving through the rags
of her bodice, her slender body quivering with anger.
</p>

<p>
"You would dare!" she cried shrilly.  "You would dare
to touch my man!  No man lives who can touch him while
I live.  He is mine, I say!  Mine!  I will cut your throat,
big French pig.  I will carve out your bowels!  I will
pick out your eyes!  I will, I say!  I will!"
</p>

<p>
She danced toward him so energetically that he cowered
and gave ground before her.
</p>

<p>
"Go!" she cried, gesturing with her pistol toward the
door.  "Quick, before I strike!"  And she leaped at him.
He clutched his wounded arm, and retreated.  "Go, I
say!"  She raised her arm to stab him again.  "Did you
think I would let you touch him?  Did not the others say
that you should only harm one of them?  And you took
my man!  Oh, I will cut you in ribbons!"
</p>

<p>
And this time he turned, and fled through the door,
slamming it behind him.  She was swift on his heels,
jerked open the door and ran out into the passage after
him.
</p>

<p>
"Run!" I heard her shout.  "I am close to you!  I,
Kara Tokalji!  My knife is at your back.  Make haste&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Then the door swung to, and shut out the echoes of
Toutou's retreat.  My whole thought was of Nikka, his
face green in the lantern-light, his empty stomach
retching with the nausea from horrible pain.  Hugh called to
him:
</p>

<p>
"Nikka, old chap!  Pull yourself together.  Can you
get me unfastened?  I'll see what I can do for&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But I promptly lost interest in Nikka's plight.  For my
ear, that I could not lift from the floor, registered once
more that peculiar clinking underground, this time more
pronounced and nearer.  I peered idly along the floor,
watched a rat flit from hole to hole, and then stiffened
with amazement as the grating in the middle of the room
lifted two or three inches.  It thudded into place again
with a shower of dust, but at once the clinking was
resumed, and the heavy stonework was pried upward.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh!" I whispered.  "Nikka!  My God, look at the
grating!  Do you see what I see?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka was still too sick to understand, but Hugh stared
at the grating, and his eyes popped from his head as he
perceived its unsteady progress upward.
</p>

<p>
We were both afraid to speak, afraid to guess what it
might mean.  And while we still watched, uncertainly,
wondering whether to hope or to fear, we heard a loud
grunt, the grating rose into the air, tottered and fell out
of place, leaving the drain only half-covered.  The end
of a steel crowbar appeared in this opening, there was
another grunt, and the grating was levered aside.
</p>

<p>
"Where's that 'ere dratted box?" muttered a familiar
voice.  "If the Servants' 'All could see me now!"
</p>

<p>
Two hands clutched the sides of the drain opening, the
grunt was repeated for the third time&mdash;and Watkins
clambered laboriously into the dungeon.
</p>

<p>
"If your ludship will pardon me a minute," he puffed.
"This work does fair do me up&mdash;at my time of life and
all, Mister Hugh, sir&mdash;and the rats down there are as
big as old Tom the mouser in the dairy at Chesby."
</p>

<p>
We could only stare at him.  Even poor Nikka forgot
his agony and peered unbelievingly at this extraordinary
apparition.
</p>

<p>
"'As that Tootoo gone, your ludship?" continued
Watkins, looking around.
</p>

<p>
He drew a pistol from his coat pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Betty told me to be sure not to shoot if I could
'elp it.  But I would 'ave taken a crack at 'im, only I
couldn't rightly see down below there, and I was afraid
'e'd tumble to me if 'e 'eard me like, so&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, Watty, where did you come from?"
burst from Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"From the drain, your ludship.  I nearly broke my
neck in the opening last night account of coming down the
rope so sudden with the Professor, and when I told Miss
Betty she said it was a gift from 'Eaven and we must
come back, which we did, your ludship."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say," asked Hugh, "that there's a
passage down there and Miss Betty is outside?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, your ludship," said Watkins, rising and
commencing to dust himself off.  "It runs out into the
big rocks on the beach.  The Professor, 'e says, sir, it's
a great discovery, it's a regular, sure-enough old Roman
sewer.  Miss Betty, she said it was nothing of the kind, it
was a gift from 'Eaven."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, thrusting myself into the conversation,
"this is no time for a debate.  If you are going to get
us out, Watty, you have got to move quickly.  Toutou and
his friends will be back any moment.  One girl can't keep
them away.  I suspect they'd have been here by now, if
she hadn't precipitated some kind of a row."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir, Mister Jack," answered Watkins,
calmly producing a knife from his belt.  "Such a
necessity was duly foreseen, if I may say so."
</p>

<p>
He went to work methodically on my lashings.
</p>

<p>
"I trust you will take notice, your ludship, that all
possible 'aste 'as been made.  It was fair mucky below
there, as you will see, gentlemen, and I barked my shins
something cruel.  Yes, sir, Mister Jack, I'm going as fast
as I can without sticking you.  What a terrible place!
And Mister Nikka 'as the stomach ache."
</p>

<p>
"He has worse than that, Watty," said Hugh grimly.
"Are the others all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, your ludship.  Ah?  Mister Jack, sir, there you
are.  One moment, sir, until I 'ave 'is ludship loose, and
I'll give you a bit of a rub."  He sawed away at Hugh's
ropes, while I slapped my cold legs with hands I could
scarcely move.  "Why, your ludship, when we came outside
we talked things over, and first off Professor King 'e
says that 'e's going in.  But I pointed out to 'im 'ow
somebody should stay with the young lady, and as 'e was
'er father and I was valet to your ludship, it was plain
that 'e should stick by the launch, whilst I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind any more," Hugh cut him off, as he
disposed of the last wrappings.  "We can talk things over
later.  Help us to get our circulation back.  Rub, man,
rub!  That's it."
</p>

<p>
Presently we were able to walk stiffly.  Our first
concern was to lower Nikka into the drain.  He was so weak
that he took very little interest in the rescue.  His initial
flare of understanding was succeeded by a semi-stupor,
and his tortured shoulder must have been agonizing,
although he never complained.  We had Watkins go down
ahead of him, and Hugh and I, between us, eased him
gently through the hole, and Watkins caught him around
the waist and steadied him.  My instinct was to follow
them immediately, but Hugh checked me.
</p>

<p>
"See here," he said, "now that we've got this secret
entrance, why do we need to let the enemy know of it?"
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" I asked stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"Can't we cover up our tracks?" he pursued.  "Here,
Watty," he called into the drain, "hand up that crowbar."
</p>

<p>
Watkins extended it, a look of alarm on his face.
</p>

<p>
"I do 'ope, your ludship, you won't run into another
mess," he remonstrated.  "Best come along right away,
sir, before Tootoo and 'is friends twig what we've done.
Really, your ludship&mdash;and I'll need some one to 'elp me
with Mister Nikka."
</p>

<p>
"You get started," returned Hugh.  "We'll be all right,
but we have a job to do first.  Get on.  We'll catch up
with you."
</p>

<p>
Watkins retired, grumbling.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll permit me," I said uneasily, "I'm inclined
to think you are mad.  Personally, I don't hanker for
Toutou's attentions.  We may lose this opportunity if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We won't lose this opportunity," answered Hugh,
"and I hope we won't lose the more valuable opportunity
I'm looking for in the future.  Help me break down the
door."
</p>

<p>
Then I appreciated his plan.  We worked the crowbar
under the sill and between the jamb and the lintel, and
with very little difficulty forced the door from its hinges.
It was old, and although heavy, had warped and was
poorly hung.  As it came free, we caught it, and let it
down gently on the floor.  I crept out into the corridor
and around a turn where a flight of stairs began.  Nobody
was in sight, but I heard a distant murmur of conversation.
To the left of the stairs a passage trended at right
angles, with a slight upward grade, and I followed it
until I came to a clumsy door of planks.  I listened at its
crack, but heard nothing, so I applied my crowbar and
forced the rickety lock.  Beyond this door stretched a
vast cellar which underlay the structure of the House of
the Married.
</p>

<p>
I waited only to make sure that it was unoccupied, and
then returned to the dungeon.  Hugh had pushed the stone
grating into position on the edge of the opening, leaving
a space barely wide enough for us to slip through.  We
dropped down, and found that when we stood on the empty
packing-box which Watty had fetched&mdash;for no special
reason, as he afterwards admitted, except that he "thought
he might want to reach up like"&mdash;with him we could
exert the necessary strength, with the help of the crowbar,
to pry the grating into its bed.
</p>

<p>
We crept away after Nikka and Watkins, feeling light-hearted
for the first time in twenty-four hours.  Ahead
of us Watkins' electric torch shone palely on the slimy,
moss-grown walls.  We splashed in water over our ankles.
Big black rats scuttled around us.  But we were at liberty,
and we licked our puffy lips with our swollen tongues at
the thought of the dismay that our enemies would feel
when they reëntered the dungeon.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
HILMI'S FRIEND
</h3>

<p>
Nikka fainted as we reached the mouth of the
drain, which was fortunate for him, as it saved
him the agony of the slippery climb over the
rocks of the beach and the ruined jetty to the <i>Curlew</i>.
At its exit the drain or sewer was blocked by a heap of
stones about four feet high across which it was difficult
for men unhindered to pass in silence, let alone men carrying
an inert body.  But we achieved it finally, and stumbled
as best we could on to the precarious footing of the jetty,
The <i>Curlew</i> was simply a black shadow nestling against
the rocks.
</p>

<p>
As we approached, two figures jumped from the deck,
and the slighter of them ran towards us.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh!" came the whispered call.  "Hugh, are you
there?  Are you safe?  Who are you carrying, Jack?  Is
it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I came first, holding Nikka's feet.  Hugh and Watkins,
supporting his shoulders, were indistinguishable in the
rear.  It struck me as mildly humorous that Betty's first
anxiety should be so ingenuously revealed.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh's all right," I answered cautiously.  "Nikka's
hurt, though.  Keep quiet, you idiot."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" she said inconsequentially, and sat down
on the rocks and commenced to cry softly.
</p>

<p>
Hugh exploded in a sentimental curse.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Watty," he growled, "you'll have to manage
by yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, your ludship," muttered Watkins.
</p>

<p>
I felt Nikka's body sag, and looked back.  Watkins was
plodding determinedly after me, panting so loudly
under his burden as to lead me to cast a wary eye at the
lightless bulk of Tokalji's house.  Hugh and Betty had
melted into a single shadow-figure from which came vague
murmurs and gasped interjections.
</p>

<p>
"Damn!" I grunted.  "What a hell of a time to pick
for making love!"
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Mister Jack, sir," panted Watkins.
</p>

<p>
We were both about done up, for Nikka was heavy and
we had to use superhuman care to avoid jouncing or
dropping him on the rocks.  But luckily Vernon King
reached us, and with his aid, we got Nikka into a bunk
in the tiny cabin.  Leaving King to take care of him,
Watkins and I returned to the cockpit.  I was fighting
mad at Hugh for philandering and at Betty for picking
such an occasion for tears.  But my rage was not proof
against the bubbling joy with which they greeted me as
they hopped aboard.
</p>

<p>
"Meet the new Lady Chesby," whispered Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear of such a thing?" said Betty.
"Why, I had no more idea when I climbed out on those
rocks&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I suppose not," I jeered.  "Well, children, let
me tell you you chose a poor time for this.  If you want
my congratulations you must help us to make a quick
get-away."
</p>

<p>
"He's right," agreed Betty, tearing herself loose from
Hugh's arm.  "We are crazy.  Jack, you loose the bow
line.  Watkins, are the sweeps ready?  Prepare to cast
off astern, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
Hugh and I were recouped with brandy and water and
sandwiches, and fifteen minutes later, with the current
to help us, we had worked out into the Marmora; and
Betty judged it safe to have Watkins turn over the engine
and switch on the lights.  I am bound to say her first
thought then was of Nikka.  She put Watkins at the wheel,
with orders to stand west at low speed, and ducked into
the cabin with us.  The electric bulb shone down on
Nikka's white face beaded with sweat.  His eyes were
still closed.  King had cut away his coat and shirt, and
was bathing his head with water from the drinking-tank.
</p>

<p>
"How is he?" asked Betty.
</p>

<p>
"He has not recovered consciousness yet," answered
her father.  "To tell the truth, I haven't tried hard to
bring him around.  I fear his shoulder is dislocated."
</p>

<p>
Betty stooped over Nikka, and felt gingerly of arm and
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, "it's dislocated.  I have seen dislocations
pulled out in the hospitals during the War.  I think
I can get his shoulder back if some of you will hold him
down.  It is bound to hurt him cruelly for the moment."
</p>

<p>
She spoke with crisp authority; her face was all keen
intelligence.  And I chuckled at the contrast with the way
in which she had come aboard with Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"We'll help," Hugh told her now.  "What do we do?"
</p>

<p>
She stationed us, Hugh bearing down on his well shoulder,
Vernon King and I grasping each a leg.  She took a
deep breath, caught arm and shoulder in her strong young
fingers, tugged, twisted with a wrench&mdash;a moan from
Nikka, lying half-conscious&mdash;and there was an audible
snap.  Betty stepped back, flushed and trembling.
</p>

<p>
"There," she said, "it's in place, but I wouldn't do it
again to-night for anything."
</p>

<p>
"Good girl," I said.
</p>

<p>
"That's praise from Sir Hubert," she acknowledged
shyly.  "Aren't you ever going to congratulate me, Jack?
Oh, Lordy, though, I've completely forgotten to tell Dad."
</p>

<p>
"But that's quite usual, my dear," said my uncle
whimsically.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a cynic like Jack, old dear," she rebuked
him with a kiss.  "You know I really have to tell you
when I'm engaged.  It happened very suddenly, and Jack
blew me up for letting it interfere with business."
</p>

<p>
"I'm inclined to agree with him," said King.  "I
suppose the young man concerned is Hugh."
</p>

<p>
Betty regarded him admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Daddy!  That's awfully brilliant of you!
However did you guess?"
</p>

<p>
Her father pinched her ear.
</p>

<p>
"Occasionally, Elizabeth," he said, "you appear to
labor under the misconception that I fail to take any note
concerning the ordinary routine happenings of the day.
But if you prefer, I will base my apprehension solely on
analytical grounds.  You leap ashore.  You call for Hugh.
You run towards him.  You delay your reappearance.
Immediately afterward you announce your engagement.
I must maintain the sequence of causes prior to the effect
presents an argument grounded on irrefutable logic."
</p>

<p>
"You win on logical as well as mere human grounds,
Vernon," I said.  "Bet, I congratulate you, minx though
you are.  If Nikka&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And at that moment Nikka opened his eyes, and sat up
in the bunk, bumping his head.
</p>

<p>
"Ouch!" he yelled.  "Where am I?  What&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He rubbed his shoulder reminiscently.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sore all over, but I have a feeling it hurt worse
a little while ago.  How did I get here?  And Hugh and
Jack?"
</p>

<p>
So we recounted to him the full story of our rescue,
which, in turn, necessitated chronicling our adventures of
the past twenty-four hours for Betty and her father.
</p>

<p>
"I imagined, of course, that a mishap such as you
describe had befallen you," remarked King when we had
finished.  "When Nikka shouted his warning, Watkins and
I held a hasty conference on the roof and decided that
your adjuration must have had sufficient urgency behind it
to warrant our obedience, however reluctant we might be
to abandon you.  Upon Watkins' insistence, I preceded
him down the rope.  Prior to his own descent, he loosened
the grapnel, with an eye to the possibility of twitching it
down, so that when he was some eight or ten feet from
the ground&mdash;my estimate, naturally, is hypothetical, as it
was impossible to gain any clear view of his accident&mdash;the
rope came free above, and he was precipitated into an
opening in the rocks which we had not hitherto perceived.
</p>

<p>
"I may say that we later determined in the daylight
that it was practically invisible from the adjacent waters,
and the hasty investigation I was able to make on my own
behalf leads me to the provisional conclusion that we have
stumbled upon a genuine archæological find.  The ancient
Byzantium, as you doubtless know, was a city vying with
our modern capitals in comfort and hygienic convenience,
and its drainage system must have been&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, Daddy," interrupted Betty, "but you are
telling about last night, not the ancient Byzants."
</p>

<p>
"Byzantines, my dear," corrected her father.  "The
Byzant was the standard coin of value of the Eastern
Empire, indeed, of the known world."
</p>

<p>
"A thousand pardons, old sweetheart, but still, don't
you see, you've left the boys high and dry?  Here, you'd
better let me carry on."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," answered King with the docility acquired
by any man who spends much time in Betty's company.
"Perhaps your narrative gifts will secure a more rapid
description of our adventures, Elizabeth."
</p>

<p>
"It's not my 'narrative gifts,' darling Dad.  It's that
I can stick to the path.  You see, boys, I heard Watkins
squawk when he fell.  The only reason Toutou and his
friends didn't hear him was that they were so busy with
you.  I left the boat and scrambled over the rocks&mdash;nearly
scared Dad to death.  He thought I was an enemy.
Watkins had disappeared into this opening.  He had slid
over the rock-pile that fills it to within three or four feet
of the top, and he bumped his head badly.  He thought
he was in a cave, and I made Dad get in after him and
look around with a flashlight.  So long as the rope and
grapnel had come down, there was no way for Toutou's
gang to trace us, and I was wondering whether we couldn't
make future use of a hiding-place almost in the enemy's
camp."
</p>

<p>
"I say, that was clever of you!" said Hugh admiringly.
</p>

<p>
We all chuckled, but Betty thanked him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was a little heroine," she continued.  "No movie
heroine could have surpassed me.  Dad took a look, and
announced that it was one of the old sewers, and seemed
to run inland beneath Tokalji's house.  He wanted to
follow it all the way in, but I decided there would be no
opportunity for a rescue that night, and I made him and
Watkins come back to the <i>Curlew</i> with me.  We ran the
launch to the wharf of a Greek fisherman I know on the
Asiatic shore of the Marmora.  He agreed to take us up
to Constantinople in his boat, and to wait there for us
all day to carry us back.
</p>

<p>
"We discussed the problem going up to Constantinople,
and we couldn't think of anything to do for you, short of
going in ourselves and setting you free.  We didn't know
how to get into touch with Nikka's uncle and his Gypsy
friends.  Manifestly, we didn't want to tell the police or
the British authorities&mdash;although we would have done that
if we had been unable to get to you to-night.  Watkins said
that 'treasure or no treasure 'e wasn't going to see 'is
ludship butchered like 'is uncle, whatever 'is ludship might
say any time.'  Oh, Watkins was lyrical, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"He's done damned good work," assented Hugh gratefully.
"Bless his old heart.  So you just went up to
Constantinople, and lay doggo?"
</p>

<p>
"Just that.  We slept most of the day, and after
dinner sneaked away, and boarded the Greek fisherman's
ketch.  We took the <i>Curlew</i> about ten, I think, and steered
straight for Tokalji's house.  And oh, Hugh, if there
hadn't been that opening from your dungeon!"  The tears
came into her eyes.  "To think what Nikka had to stand!
And you others would have had it, too."
</p>

<p>
"If there hadn't been that there would have been
something else," Hugh reassured her.  "And now we have a
secret way to follow direct into Tokalji's lair."
</p>

<p>
"But after you get in you will have a pitched battle
before you can control the place," Nikka pointed out.
"I don't see that you are likely to profit very much by
it unless you are willing to put the issue to the proof by
cold steel."
</p>

<p>
There was no gainsaying this argument, and none of us
was inclined to advocate wholesale slaughter, not even
Nikka, with his aching shoulder and memory of Toutou's
brutality.  We had hashed over the subject pretty
thoroughly by the time the <i>Curlew</i> was docked, without
discovering a solution of our problem, and from sheer
weariness abandoned the discussion by mutual consent.  It was
too late to find one of the variable Pera taxis, and we
walked up through the deserted streets of Galata, tenanted
only by homeless refuges.  In the hotel lobby we said
good-night&mdash;it was really good-morning&mdash;and went to bed to
sleep the clock around.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-four hours rest made us fit.  Nikka's arm and
shoulder were still lame, but he had Watkins rub him with
liniment that suppled the strained muscles, and declared
that he was as game for a fight as any of us.  And when
Watkins brought us an invitation to breakfast in the
Kings' sitting room we were able to muster a degree of
optimism, despite the difficulties of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"It boils down to this," said Hugh over his second cup
of coffee.  "We know that the Instructions are correct
and that we have a desperate crew of criminals to reckon
with.  Our job is to trick Toutou's crowd."
</p>

<p>
"But how?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that's the question!"
</p>

<p>
"You can't trick them," snapped Nikka.  "They are
as clever as we."
</p>

<p>
"Then what can you do?" demanded Betty.
</p>

<p>
"Exterminate them."
</p>

<p>
"Your proposal, Nikka, seems somewhat&mdash;er&mdash;shall I say
savage?" objected Vernon King.
</p>

<p>
"We are fighting savages," retorted Nikka swiftly.  "I
still feel as I did last night that I don't want to risk any
of our lives, treasure or no treasure, beyond what is
essential to our safety.  But the fact remains there is but
one kind of treatment those people will understand.  They
are clever, remorseless, merciless.  You can&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a knock on the door.  Watkins answered it.
His back stiffened as he peered through the crack.
</p>

<p>
"A moment, if you please, sir," he said coldly,
refastened the door and turned to us.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. 'Ilyer would like a word with your ludship."
</p>

<p>
Hugh rose, his jaw set.
</p>

<p>
"I'll talk to him outside," he said.
</p>

<p>
Watkins reopened the door, and bowed him out.  We
heard his first icy words:
</p>

<p>
"To what am I indebted for this&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The door closed behind him, and we looked at each other,
startled, uneasy.  Nobody said anything.  We were
all thinking of the conversation going on in the
corridor.
</p>

<p>
The tense silence lasted for perhaps five minutes.  Then
the door was reopened, and Hugh entered.
</p>

<p>
"Hilyer wants to talk terms," he announced.  "In the
circumstances, I didn't feel that we could afford to
overlook any chance, and I have arranged that four of us will
meet four of his crowd at Hilmi's house at three this
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"I don't trust the dog," I said immediately.  "Why go
to Hilmi's house?  Why couldn't he talk here?"
</p>

<p>
"He said the only way he could prove that he has a
certain trick up his sleeve would be for us to go there.
He also pointed out that we need have no fear of treachery,
as we only needed to leave word behind us where we were
going."
</p>

<p>
"Why parties of four?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Obviously, we couldn't take Betty," answered Hugh,
"and one of us ought to stay with her."
</p>

<p>
"If Toutou is there I shall kill him on sight," warned
Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"I told Hilyer we drew the line at that beast.  Besides
Hilyer and Hilmi, there will be only Hélène de Cespedes
and Serge Vassilievich."
</p>

<p>
"Humph, I still don't see why we should go out of our
way to talk to them," I grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"Hilyer seemed in a reasonable frame of mind," argued
Hugh.  "He said his crowd are sick of the whole business,
that they as well as we are wasting time, and that we might
as well compromise."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you have no such idea in your head," exclaimed
Betty.  "You couldn't trust them, in any event."
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't&mdash;not yet, anyway," returned Hugh.  "I
told Hilyer we had no reason to be discouraged, but he
just grinned.  He said it was a stalemate.  What I am
after is to feel out the enemy's position."
</p>

<p>
None of us could think up a valid reason for objecting
to Hugh's strategy, so it was agreed that he, Vernon King,
Nikka and myself should keep the appointment at Hilmi's
house.  Betty said that she would take Watkins and go
for a sail in the <i>Curlew</i>, and we all approved her plan
because we considered her safest on the water.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon we escorted Betty and Watkins to the
Man-o'-war Dock, saw them off and then walked through
Pera to Hilmi's house in the Rue Midhat Pasha.  It was
a handsome residence in the French style.  As we
approached it from the corner, a big automobile halted in
front of the entrance, and Hilmi, himself, appeared in the
doorway, ushering out a stout personage, whose frock-coat,
fez and predatory visage proclaimed the Turkish
official.  The man scarcely glanced at us, merely climbed
into his machine and drove away.  Hilmi, awaiting us
on the doorstep, rubbed his hands together, with an oily
smirk of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Your servant, gentlemen," he said, with mock humility.
"Did you happen to recognize my guest who departed as
you arrived?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Hugh curtly.
</p>

<p>
Hilmi had a peculiar effect on you.  He was a rat.  You
didn't so much hate him or desire to kill him as you did
hanker to kick him or stamp on him.
</p>

<p>
He saw this, and his smirk became a sour grimace.
</p>

<p>
"Follow me," he snarled.
</p>

<p>
We passed through a square hall, carpeted and hung
with gorgeous Persian, Bokharan and Chinese rugs, into
a salon which was a bizarre combination of rickety French
period furniture and priceless, solid Oriental stuff.  The
rugs, as in the hall, were worth a fortune by themselves.
Hilyer, Hélène and Serge Vassilievich were lounging on
a couch, smoking cigarettes and talking in low tones.  The
men rose as we came in, Hilyer with a swagger, the
Russian with a frown that presently focussed on my
face&mdash;it seemed he had never forgotten or forgiven the beating
I gave him in the Gunroom at Chesby.
</p>

<p>
Hélène lay back against a pile of cushions, languorously
at ease, beautiful as a tigress, a pleasant smile curving
her faultless lips.  Other than the smile, she made no move
to greet us.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, won't you?" said Hilyer, automatically
taking charge.  "Glad you came.  Cigarettes?  Cocktail?
I assure you quite all right; taste 'em myself, if you like.
No?  Right O!  Did they see your friend, Hilmi?"
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;" Hilmi pointed a finger at Chesby&mdash;"says he
did not know him."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  Hilyer lighted a fresh cigarette.  "Don't take
my word for it, you chaps, but that man was Youssouf
Mahkouf Pasha, who is popularly known in this part of
the world as 'The Grand Vizier's Jackal.'  You probably
do not see why you should be interested in him and his
presence here to-day.  The fact is, however, that his visit
to this house was timed so that you should have an
opportunity to see him.  We particularly desired you to see
him, knowing that you&mdash;ah&mdash;" he smiled agreeably&mdash;"might
be inclined to doubt the veracity of whatever we
said to you.
</p>

<p>
"To cut a long story short, Mahkouf Pasha is a
particular pal of our fellow club-member, Hilmi.  I don't
mind lettin' you in on it that they've been in several deals
together.  Now, we owe you a bit on account.  Last night,
for instance.  But I gather that you yourselves aren't able
to ride clear on the strength of it."
</p>

<p>
He paused, and Hugh caught him up.
</p>

<p>
"You have no right to suppose that," Hugh retorted
sharply.  "We aren't asking terms.  You are."
</p>

<p>
"I notice you aren't refusing to discuss terms," said
Hilyer with a glint in his eye.
</p>

<p>
Yassilievich jerked a remark which we could not understand
from the corner of his mouth, but Hilyer waved it
aside.
</p>

<p>
"Go at the narrow ditch first, Serge.  There'll be plenty
of time for the water-jump.  I'm not tryin' to bluff you
and your friends, Chesby.  I don't have to.  As I told you
this morning, I have an ace in my sleeve.  Bein' a
gambler, that's my habit."
</p>

<p>
"So I've heard," said Hugh with cutting emphasis.
</p>

<p>
Hilyer never changed color, only eyed him curiously.
</p>

<p>
"You do get down on a fellow, don't you?" he commented.
"As you know by now, there's but one way to
dust me.  You tried it once, and I haven't forgotten.
I've a convenient memory of my own.
</p>

<p>
"Well, never mind.  The fact is, you are stumped just
is much as we are.  We are plugging around the course,
and neither one of us can jockey a horse clear of the field.
It's damn nonsense.  Gets nobody anywhere.  Sensible
thing to do is to lay cards on the table, and make a deal."
</p>

<p>
"Put down your hand," said Hugh evenly.
</p>

<p>
"The treasure is somewhere around Tokalji's house,"
answered Hilyer promptly.  "That's certain.  To get to
it you've got to get into Tokalji's house.  What's more,
you've got to be able to stay a while in Tokalji's house.
And you can't do it.  You haven't got a chance of doing
it!  But let's suppose a miracle happened, and you found
the chance."  He dropped his cigarette, and leaned
forward, driving his clenched fist into his palm to emphasize
every word.  "Still, we've got you stopped.  How?
Hilmi's friend, Mahkouf Pasha.  We've made arrangements
with him, whereby in the event that we give up hope of
any better deal, we denounce you and your treasure to
him.  He will then convey the information to the Imperial
Government, and in return for his public service and for
our assistance, he and we will be presented with a stipulated
percentage of the treasure, as recovered."
</p>

<p>
He sat back on the couch, and crossed his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Those are good cards, providing they are played right,"
Hugh admitted.  "But how is the Imperial Government
going to secure the treasure's location from us?"
</p>

<p>
"If they don't secure the information, nevertheless you
won't get the treasure.  To be quite plain with you, our
plan, in the event of the contingency I have outlined, would
be to give you an opportunity to get to the treasure
before calling in the Government."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that would be the way to do it," said Hugh,
nodding impersonally.  "What's your proposition?"
</p>

<p>
"Seventy-five per cent. to us, twenty-five per cent. to
you."
</p>

<p>
Hugh laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you wanted to talk business," he jeered.
</p>

<p>
Hélène tossed away her cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"You're playing it too fine, Montey," she remarked.
"Will you talk on a fifty-fifty basis, Lord Chesby?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he said frankly.  "I want to think it
over.  I'll admit that by calling in the Turkish Government,
you could stall me&mdash;and yourselves.  But how can I
trust you?  What guarantees can you give us?"
</p>

<p>
"No guarantees we could give you would be binding,"
she answered with an insolent smile.  "What's more, we
don't have to give guarantees.  We hold the whip-hand.
You've no alternative but to trust us.  As to thinking it
over&mdash;" she flung a glance at Hilyer, who nodded&mdash;"come
back to-morrow.  We'll give you that long."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take as long as I choose," returned Hugh, with a
flash of temper&mdash;he, like the rest of us, was becoming
restive under the realization that they did hold the
whip-hand.  "And understand me, I mean what I say when I
tell you that any compromise between us will be based on
what we consider satisfactory guarantees."
</p>

<p>
Hilyer yawned lazily.
</p>

<p>
"Don't like it, do you?  Doesn't feel comfortable to be
spurred.  Well, suit yourselves.  So far as we are
concerned, remember, we'd rather come to terms with you.
We stand to get more out of you than from the Turkish
Government.  But if you try to trick us we won't be
beyond denouncing you, even at the cost of losing any
share at all."
</p>

<p>
His teeth clicked and his drawl became a measured
threat.
</p>

<p>
"Incidentally, this is not the only ace we have up our
sleeve.  Our terms will be stiffer to-morrow than they are
to-day, and progressively so from then on."
</p>

<p>
"That goes," added Hélène de Cespedes, rearing her
lithe body erect, all pretense of languor gone.  "That's
legal tender, Lord Chesby.  You people are backing a
losing game.  The cards are stacked against you.  You lose,
no matter what you do."
</p>

<p>
"We'll see about that," said Hugh, rising, a spot of
red on each cheek bone the one sign of the white-hot anger
that seethed within him.
</p>

<p>
"Must you go?" asked Hilyer, his drawl resumed.  "Au
'voir, then.  Hilmi, will you see 'em out?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
OUR BACKS TO THE WALL
</h3>

<p>
Hilmi Bey bowed us out, his smirk more tigerish
than ever.  It seemed to us that he had a perfect
right to enjoy our departure.  We felt that we
had come off distinctly second-best.
</p>

<p>
"Score for them," remarked Hugh, as we shook the
dust of the Rue Midhat Pasha from our shoes.  "We're
chivvied, dished."
</p>

<p>
"They won't do it," I objected.  "And if they did, it
wouldn't get them anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"You're right," assented Hugh.  "But there's the delay.
This is expensive, Jack, and we can't hang on
forever.  If we could wear them out, why&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You are both wrong!" exclaimed Nikka energetically.
"You must remember that you are in Constantinople.
Things don't happen here as they do in Europe."
</p>

<p>
"Constantinople is in Europe," I objected&mdash;and
promptly felt like the fool the remark demonstrated me to
be.
</p>

<p>
Nikka favored me with a withering glance of contempt.
</p>

<p>
"We are not talking in terms of geography, but of human
nature," he said.  "This is the Orient.  You ought to
realize that, Jack, after what you have seen with me.  And
in the Orient, and especially in Turkey, such a graft deal
as Hilyer made with Mahkouf Pasha would not excite any
interest, much less condemnation.  It's the regular thing."
</p>

<p>
"You forget the Allied High Commissioners," interjected King.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't.  They can go only just so far.  Their position
is delicate enough, without imperiling their prestige
by interfering in what would be strictly a question of
Turkish internal government.  They'd know that a windfall
such as this treasure would be used simply to further
Pan-Islamic intrigue and bolster the coffers of the
Nationalist Government at Angora.  But for that very reason
they wouldn't be able to interfere.  I tell you, it would
be the height of bad luck for us if the struggle for the
treasure took on a political tinge.  It would be fatal.
We might as well pack up, and go home."
</p>

<p>
"Guess you're right," assented Hugh thoughtfully.  "It
looks as though we were pocketed.'
</p>

<p>
"What puzzles me is why they didn't try something like
this before," continued Nikka.  "I fancy they wanted to
be very sure of their man first."
</p>

<p>
"Surely, they won't have told him!" protested King.
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Mahkouf?  Oh, no.  They're too wise.  No.
they've simply explained to him the general proposition
and arranged tentative terms.  They won't trust him any
farther than they have to."
</p>

<p>
"Is it your idea that we've got to accept their offer?"
asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"It's my idea that we've got to use our wits, and act
quickly," said Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't trust them," I cried.  "Hélène as much
as told you so.  We'd get the stuff out&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If it's there," Hugh reminded me.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;if it's there, then, and they would think nothing of
jumping us, either by force or by some damned trick."
</p>

<p>
"They might even stage a fake hold-up on the part of
a Government agency," Nikka added cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"In plain language, their proposition is: heads we win
tails you lose," said Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, supposing you permit them to take the lead from
your hands," agreed Nikka.  "However, I am reminded
of a memorable address I was once privileged to listen to
as a soldier of the Legion.  A general named Foch read
us a citation, and then told us how to go on winning more.
'I have noticed,' he said, 'that it is the soldier who
attacks who wins battles.  The initiative is the price of
victory.  Never permit your foe to assume the initiative.
Attack!  Always attack!'"
</p>

<p>
"True," assented Hugh.  "And we've been able to stall
their gang so far by taking the initiative."
</p>

<p>
"But if we can't?" inquired King.  "Optimism is all
right, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Optimism is all we've got," interrupted Nikka.  "We
have our backs to the wall.  This is the time to fight, if
fighting will get us anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"If it will!" echoed Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"That's what we have to decide," said Nikka.  "You
can't work out a problem like this in the street."
</p>

<p>
We walked the remainder of the distance to the hotel
at a breakneck gait.  As we entered the lobby one of the
clerks came from the office and accosted Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Your messenger would not wait, milord," he said.
"Mees King had not returned.  Indeed, she has not yet
returned."
</p>

<p>
"My messenger?" repeated Hugh, with a startled look
at us.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, milord.  He said he must see her.  When I told
heem she had gone out he left your letter for her, weeth
instructions that I present it so soon as she came in."
</p>

<p>
Hugh's face creased into grim lines.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  As long as she has not yet returned, I will
take it back."
</p>

<p>
The clerk went to the mail-desk, and plucked an
envelope from Betty's letter-box.  Hugh thanked him, and
turned it over in his hand.  It was addressed in an
extraordinarily scrawling hand to "Miss King."  In the lower
left-hand corner was written: "By messenger."
</p>

<p>
"But it looks nothing like your handwriting," exclaimed
King.  "I am at a loss to comprehend how persons so
adroit as our opponents have demonstrated themselves to
be could hope to secure success by means of such a shallow
trick."
</p>

<p>
"We'll see," returned Hugh brusquely, slitting the
envelope.  "I have a notion this is the other ace Hilyer
bragged about."
</p>

<p>
The envelope held a single sheet of paper.  On it was
written in the same scrawling hand:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Dear Bet:</i>
</p>

<p>
"I've broken my arm, which explains this abominable writing.
I never could do anything with my left hand.  Don't worry,
I shall be fit in no time.  Can you come with the bearer, or if
that is not convenient, with Watkins, to the house in Sokaki
Masyeri?  It's important.  Can't write any more.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"HUGH."
</p>

<p>
"P.S.  The others are all right.  The bearer can't wait."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Can you beat that!" I gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Exceedingly ingenious," murmured King.  "Dear me,
how fortunate it was that we returned when we did."
</p>

<p>
"We mustn't leave anything to chance, though," said
Nikka quickly: "You can't tell what other steps they
may have taken to trap her.  We had better go down to
the dock at once."
</p>

<p>
Hugh glanced at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she'd hardly be back yet," he muttered.  "One
moment.  I'll leave word at the desk that she is not to go
out, no matter what message she may receive, until we
return."
</p>

<p>
He rejoined us at the door, and we all entered a taxi
which Nikka had impounded.  Nobody said anything, but
while we were jolting into Galata Hugh produced his
automatic, and make sure it contained a full clip.  At the
dock there was no sign of the <i>Curlew</i>, and the late afternoon
sunlight failed to reveal her stubby little hull amongst
the shipping in the Golden Horn.  None of the dock
attendants had seen the launch or anything of Betty or
Watkins since we had waved good-by to them before three
o'clock.
</p>

<p>
We waited a while, thinking they might show up, but
after six o'clock King became nervous and persuaded us
to return to the hotel.  There, too, there was no word of
them, and we began to worry in earnest.  Dusk was coming
on rapidly, and it was not like Betty to protract her
cruise so late, although she was fully capable of navigating
after dark, with the help of Watkins, or, for that
matter, without his help.
</p>

<p>
We taxied to the dock a second time.  The <i>Curlew</i> was
nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it would be advisable to hire a boat and search
for them in the Marmora," suggested King.  "Their
engine may have broken down."
</p>

<p>
"We had better not split our forces," Nikka objected.
</p>

<p>
"Engine trouble would never bother Betty," Hugh said.
"Still, I don't like it."
</p>

<p>
"We are probably worrying about nothing," I said.
"After all, it was a blessing in disguise that she stayed
out so late.  It insured against her being caught by that
note in case we hadn't intercepted it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not interested in 'if,' and 'had,'" snapped Hugh.
"I don't like this delay.  Those devils of Toutou's are
capable of having an extra trick in reserve."
</p>

<p>
"I vote we go back to the hotel," proposed Nikka;
"maybe I can pick up one of my Gypsies.  We could start
them out on the trail."
</p>

<p>
Nikka's suggestion did not make anybody any happier.
It indicated that he, like the rest of us, was commencing
to take the situation more seriously than he cared to admit
openly.  But we climbed into the smelly taxi for the fourth
time, and were jounced up to Pera.  The hotel people
regarded us with some amazement when Vernon King again
inquired for his daughter.  No, she had not returned.  Was
anything wrong?
</p>

<p>
King hesitated, looked at us.  It was hard to know what
to say.  Something might be wrong.  And yet the chances
were that the only thing wrong was a cranky motor.  We
didn't want publicity.  We couldn't afford to attract
unnecessary attention.  Our party was sufficiently conspicuous,
as it was, and was taken for granted and let alone
largely because it included an American millionaire
archæologist and an English milord, both of whom, by
all the rules of the Orient, were naturally assumed to be
harmless lunatics.
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered at length, "I think not.  My daughter
has a reliable servant with her.  I am simply anxious
for her return."
</p>

<p>
The hotel management were all sympathy.  Monsieur
need not worry.  Let him dine in comfort.  The instant
Mademoiselle returned or word of her arrived he should
be apprised.  In the meantime, why concern himself
unnecessarily?
</p>

<p>
"They're right," said Hugh as we grouped in the lobby,
canvassing our next step.  "We've had a hard day, and
we need food.  Let's eat.  By the way, Nikka, did you see
your Gypsies?"
</p>

<p>
"No, and if anything much had gone wrong, I think&mdash;at
least, there's a strong probability&mdash;they would spot it
sooner or later and report to me."
</p>

<p>
"Obviously, we have done all we can for the present,"
said Vernon King.  "Hugh's suggestion is a good one.
Perhaps food and a rest will sharpen our wits."
</p>

<p>
We went to the Kings' sitting room, where we had
breakfasted that morning, and sat down wearily, discouraged,
disheartened, more than a little dismayed.  But as my
uncle had said, food and wine and black coffee brightened
our despondency.  We were on the point of deciding that
the best policy would be to risk dividing forces, sending
Hugh and Vernon King on a chartered boat to scour
near-by waters, while Nikka and I attempted to investigate
Sokaki Masyeri, when Watkins entered unannounced.
</p>

<p>
He was very pale.  His collar was streaked with blood.
There was an ugly bump on the side of his head.  He
dragged one foot after the other.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, your ludship," he murmured, and dropped into
a chair.
</p>

<p>
At once he strove to regain his feet, but collapsed again.
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon, I'm sure, your ludship&mdash;no disrespect
intended&mdash;fair dead beat I am, sir&mdash;my 'ead and all&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hugh seized a glass of champagne and carried it to
him, holding the glass to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Where is&mdash;"  Hugh's tongue boggled Betty's name.
</p>

<p>
"They&mdash;they've&mdash;took 'er, your ludship," answered
Watkins faintly.
</p>

<p>
"How?  Where?  Is she alive?"
</p>

<p>
King sprang from his chair, wringing his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God!  She is all I have!  What has happened?
Where is she?  Please tell me!"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," said Nikka quietly.  "He's all in.
Give him food and some more to drink.  That's right,
Jack.  There's a bottle of whiskey over there.  Pour a
stiff dram into a cup of coffee, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
With stimulants to help him, and a cold cloth on his
head, Watkins regained control of himself.
</p>

<p>
"It 'appened so quick I don't rightly know 'ow it was,"
he said.  "We 'ad run out beyond the Princes Islands, and
I saw there was little shipping around, your ludship and
gentlemen.  And then there was a fishing-boat with power
bore down on us.  Miss Betty and I, we didn't think
anything about it until 'e was right on us.  Even then we
thought they'd only lost control of their rudder like.
But when they bumped us and tumbled aboard I knew
they wasn't up to no good, your ludship.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Betty reached for 'er gun, and so did I.  But
somebody grabbed 'er, and somebody else pushed me over,
at the same a chap lashed at me with an iron-weighted
club.  'E thought 'e'd knocked my brains out, and 'e
would, too, except I fell so fast on account of bein' pushed,
I was under the level of the rail when the club 'it me and
most of the blow went into the rail.  Splintered it, it did,
your ludship.  And but for that I wouldn't be 'ere."
</p>

<p>
"And Miss Betty?" questioned Hugh eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, your ludship.  When I saw anything
again I was lyin' on the floor of the cockpit, dusk was
coming on and the launch was drifted far out to sea.
They'd stopped the engine.  I don't know 'ow I got back
'ere.  My 'ead went round and round.  But I thought if
I could get to you, your ludship and gentlemen, maybe
we could think of something else to do.  Just give me
a chance to lay my 'ands on that 'ere Tootoo!  I'll bash
'is 'ead for 'im."
</p>

<p>
"They did have a spare trick ready," commented Nikka.
"Our visit to Hilmi was part of a plot to get hold of Betty.
You see, they would have caught her, whether she had
gone sailing or not."
</p>

<p>
"You said this afternoon we had our back to the wall,"
said Hugh.  "You were right.  They've licked us.  Our
only chance is to clean them up."
</p>

<p>
The room-telephone rang.  King answered it.
</p>

<p>
"Send him up," he said.  And to Nikka: "A Gypsy
asking for you."
</p>

<p>
"That will be Wasso Mikali," cried Nikka.  "He must
have learned something.  I thought he would.  Don't be
downhearted, Hugh.  This hand is a long way from being
played out.  It is as I thought all along; we have got
to meet savagery with savagery.  It is a case of kill or
be killed."
</p>

<p>
"But Betty!" exclaimed Vernon King.  "Think of her!
What will they&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am thinking of her," retorted Nikka.  "If we hope
to rescue her we must strike hard.  Give them time, let
them strengthen their position&mdash;and she will go to some
harem in Anatolia or to a procurer in Salonika.  I tell
you, I know.  We are dealing with men and women who
have no mercy, who fight like animals, who are animals.
Well, from now on, Nikka Zaranko will meet them on their
own ground."
</p>

<p>
There was a knock on the door.  Wasso Mikali entered,
his garish Gypsy dress in striking contrast to the Western
furnishings and our own conventional garments.
</p>

<p>
"I greet you, son of my sister," he said calmly.  "My
young men, watching in Sokaki Masyeri this evening,
beheld Tokalji's party carry in a bundle in a sack, which
was a body.  I have hastened that you should know it."
</p>

<p>
Nikka clasped his hand.
</p>

<p>
"It is well, my uncle.  I thank you for the news.  This
is the night of blood of which I have spoken.  We shall
all dip our blades before the sun rises to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"My heart is glad," replied Wasso Mikali, with flashing
eyes.  "My young men's knives are eager.  Their
hands are ready.  What is the plan?"
</p>

<p>
Nikka turned to us.
</p>

<p>
"I must go with my people," he said.  "Hugh, do you
and Jack think you could keep the gang in play by a
surprise attack through the drain?  That would give us
a chance to force the street-entrance, and we should have
them between two fires."
</p>

<p>
"And where am I going to be?" demanded Vernon King
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"This will be a nasty affair, Professor," returned Nikka.
"You ought to stay out.  We are younger men, and we
are used to this kind of thing."
</p>

<p>
"Betty is my daughter, and I am as able to fight for
her as any of you," answered King.  "I know how to
handle a pistol."
</p>

<p>
"We ought not to refuse you, you know," said Hugh.
"Every man is going to count."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly expect to be counted," replied King.
</p>

<p>
"Me, too, your ludship and Mister Nikka, sir," spoke
up Watty, lunging to his feet.  "Yes, I will, gentlemen.
You give me another glass of that 'ere whiskey or arak
or whatever you call it, and I'll fight 'em all by myself.
Yes, I will.  And I guess I can swing a crowbar, if I 'ave
got a bump on my 'ead.  Let me at 'em, gentlemen, only
let me.  That's all I ask."

CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
IN THE STORM
</h3>

<p>
It was beginning to rain when we left the hotel, with
occasional peals of thunder; but we welcomed the
change in the weather as a factor aiding the surprise
attack we had intended.  At the Galata end of the Lower
Bridge, which was deserted as usual after dark, we
dismissed our taxi, and held a final brief council of war in
a patch of shadows next the bridge abutment.  King,
Hugh, Watkins and I were to embark on the <i>Curlew</i>, while
Nikka and Wasso Mikali tramped to the Khan of the
Georgians and rallied Mikali's six young men.  Then they
were to go to Sokaki Masyeri, and wait for a pistol-shot,
which would be the signal that we had passed through
the drain and were at grips with the enemy.  Hugh and
Nikka compared watches and agreed that we should be in
Tokalji's house not later than half-past ten.
</p>

<p>
The rain let up as we shook hands and wished each
other luck, but by the time the <i>Curlew</i> was chugging down
the Golden Horn it had set in again with tripled violence,
lashed on by a northeast gale.  At intervals broad splotches
of lightning bathed the city to our right in a ghastly
greenish glow.  And when we emerged into the Bosphorus
we found a fairly high sea running, but the launch
sturdily thrust her bow into the waves and rode
buoyantly over them.  We cautiously felt our way along,
lights out, motor running at half-speed, taking bearings
whenever the jagged lightning streaks illuminated the
waters.
</p>

<p>
I was worried by the frequency of the lightning
displays, but fortunately, as we sighted the round tower
on the walls, which was our first landmark for Tokalji's
house, there was a lull in the storm.  We were also favored
in having the old sea-walls act as a lee for us as we worked
in closer to shore.  The waves moderated, and the
fish-hook curve of the ruined jetty broke their remaining
force.  When Watkins had made fast bow and stern lines
to a couple of masses of battered masonry the <i>Curlew</i>
floated almost as easily as at her moorings by the Man-o-war
Dock.  But the difficulties of navigation in the
darkness and the necessity for extreme care had slowed our
progress, and we were some minutes behind our schedule.
</p>

<p>
The rocks of the jetty, too, were awash, and it was as
much as your life was worth to slip, for a fall might mean
a broken head or limb.  At one point, indeed, several of us
lost the jetty altogether and were obliged to swim
half-a-dozen strokes to the beach.  Watkins, who insisted on
arming himself with a crowbar, would have drowned if
Hugh had not hauled him in by the scuff of the neck.  It
was impossible to see anything, except once when a
lightning flash streaked the sky and struck with a stunning
report in Scutari across the Straits.  And then we were
so afraid of being discovered that we froze stiff as close
to the rocks as possible.
</p>

<p>
The beach, like the jetty, was under water.  The waves
lapped up to the foot of the walls, and we stumbled
desperately over submerged rocks and bowlders.  Watkins,
just ahead of me in line, tripped, and very nearly knocked
my brains out with his infernal crowbar.  I begged him
to drop it, but he doggedly refused.
</p>

<p>
"I'm no knife-fighter, Mister Jack, sir," he said, "and
I'm intending to give the persons that 'it me a taste of
their own stew like."
</p>

<p>
We identified the opening of the sewer by the hollow,
booming sound with which, every now and then, an
unusually high wave would roll over its lip.  It sounded
like the beating of a watery bass-drum.  The rain was
driving down again, and the wind blew overhead with a
shrill vehemence that was deafening.
</p>

<p>
"We'll never be able to get through that 'ell-'ole
tonight, Mister Jack, sir," screamed Watkins in my ear.
"We'll be drowned along with the rats."
</p>

<p>
I was somewhat of Watty's opinion, myself, but
managed to placate him.  Hugh, without any hesitation,
yelled: "One at a time!" and slipped into the sewer
mouth between two waves.  King followed him, and Watty
and I brought up the rear.  We were cheered to find the
place less terrifying than we had imagined it.  The water
was thigh-deep, instead of knee-deep, as it had been when
we escaped from the dungeon, but once you had fumbled
your way by torch-light over the jagged moraine that
blocked the first thirty feet, the footing became safer and
the water shallowed.
</p>

<p>
Just the same, I never think of the place without
shuddering.  It was deathly silent, except for the ceaseless
seepage of moisture, the occasional muffled boom of a
wave spattering over its mouth and the squeaking of the
gigantic black rats that swam ahead of us or wriggled into
cracks in the serried courses of the masonry.  Our electric
torches shone feebly on the mossy walls, with their
sickening fungus growths, their bright green, pendent weeds.
Amorphous plants hung from the roof.  The atmosphere
was slimy, noisome, unclean.  And always there was the
"drip-drip-drip" of water.
</p>

<p>
We breathed more comfortably when our torches revealed
overhead the bars of the stone grating in the floor
of the dungeon.
</p>

<p>
"All quiet above," whispered Hugh, after listening
intently.  "Dark as hell, too.  I say, how much farther do
you suppose this drain goes?"
</p>

<p>
He trained his torch into the thick murk of the immense
tube which extended beyond the grating as far as our eyes
could penetrate.
</p>

<p>
"I'm inclined to believe it continues into the city,
ably as far as the site of the Forum of Theodosius,"
King replied, his scholar's interest awake.  "That was a
region of palaces which would have required such a
work of engineering.  It should be well worth exploring."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that now," urged Hugh.  "We have another
task on hand."
</p>

<p>
He pried up the grating with Watty's crowbar, the
butt of which we rested on the ledge in which the grating
fitted.  This secured a space sufficiently wide for us to
squeeze through, and after all of us had climbed up we
eased the grating back into its bed, so that there was no
trace remaining of our entrance.
</p>

<p>
The dungeon was the same barren cube of dusty stone
that we had left by virtue of Watkins's aid.  The ropes
that had bound us were still on the floor where we had
cast them.  The door we had broken leaned against the
wall.  Obviously, Tokalji and his people had never even
suspected how we had escaped, apparently, did not even
know of the existence of the sewer.[<a id="chap24fn1text"></a><a href="#chap24fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap24fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap24fn1text">1</a>] Tokalji expressed great surprise when we told him about the
sewer.  He refused to enter it, and seemed to regard it as a danger
to his house.  Nikka thought that he would try to fill it in, but I
believe Kara, who feared nothing, pointed out to him its usefulness
for illicit purposes, and he changed his mind.  J.N.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is strange, and I fancy the only answer is Nikka's:
that the modern non-Christian inhabitants of Constantinople
look with superstitious fear upon the vast underground
structures&mdash;baths, cisterns, conduits and sewers&mdash;left
by the ancient Roumis, as the builders are usually
called, do not want to see them or hear of them, never
enter it if by chance one is discovered, and cover them up
whenever they can.
</p>

<p>
It was five minutes to eleven when we gained the dungeon,
and we knew that Nikka must be at a loss to account
for our failure to signal him.  He might suppose us to
be casualties of the storm, and in desperation, attack alone
on his own account.  So we wasted no time, beyond shaking
the water from our clothes.
</p>

<p>
The lower passage and cellars were deserted, but as we
climbed the stairs leading to the central hall opening on
the little atrium between the Garden of the Cedars and the
large chamber which Tokalji occupied we heard a distant
murmur of voices in disagreement.  Investigation proved
the hall to be unoccupied, and we were presently grouped
on its uneven floor, with only a curtain separating us from
the drama going on in the atrium.  The rain was
drumming down overhead; the wind howled with undiminished
force; and at intervals the thunder boomed like a barrage
of 155s.
</p>

<p>
"No, you are wrong, Toutou, it is everybody's business,"
said Hilyer in French.
</p>

<p>
"You may be chief, but you have no right to risk
common property," protested Sandra's resonant voice.
</p>

<p>
Toutou snarled something in his guttural, indistinct,
animal speech.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;like her, and that's enough," it concluded.  "I'm
tired of the rest of you.  Bunglers, every one."
</p>

<p>
"Have it your own way," said Serge, "but it's not
business.  She's worth so much to us.'
</p>

<p>
"One might suppose you a green youth," cut in Maude
Hilyer's frigid tones.  "Why should you endanger our
coup for a colorless chit like&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I say there is no risk," snapped Toutou.  "What do
I care for them?  What does it matter what they&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," interrupted Hilyer, "but you Continentals
don't appreciate the Anglo-Saxons' feeling about their
women.  You&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Have done," bellowed Toutou with a sudden flame of
temper.  "Urrr-rr-rrhhh!  Am I not the master?  I want
her, and I shall have her!  Go!  Go!  I say, or you shall
behold Toutou's knife."
</p>

<p>
They evidently went, for we could hear the shuffling of
feet, with an undercurrent of muttered curses and
objurgations.  Hugh started forward, pistol in hand, but I
checked him.  This was no time for unpremeditated
action.  There was a moment of silence&mdash;and a woman's cry
of hatred.
</p>

<p>
"Leave me alone, you beast!  If you touch me, I'll bite
you!  You can't bind my teeth.  Ah&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
It was Betty's voice, and Hugh shook me off and was
at the curtain with his hand on the folds before I could
reach him.  But reach him I did, and another interruption
helped me to restrain him.  King, his face white and his
hands shaking, joined us.  Watkins lurked behind us.
</p>

<p>
"Let me&mdash;" gasped Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"There's plenty of time, you fool," I hissed.  "Wait!
Somebody&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I was going to say that somebody might come back, and
the somebody cut my sentence in the middle.  A door
opened, and the voice of Hélène de Cespedes spoke.
</p>

<p>
"What is this I hear, mon ami?" she asked.  "Are you
mad?  This girl is the spoil of the band.  She belongs to
all of us.  We are holding her for a bigger stake.  Shall
we let you have her for your own satisfaction?  You take
too&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You are jealous," snarled Toutou.  "I say I want her,
and I am going to have her.  I am tired of women like
you."
</p>

<p>
Hugh, his nerves under control, gently parted the folds
of the curtain with his pistol-muzzle.  The atrium was
brilliantly lighted.  He and I could see perfectly.  On a
divan heaped with cushions lay Betty.  Her hands were
bound behind her, and her feet were tied loosely.  Her hair
was rumpled, and her blouse ripped off at the shoulder.
But her eyes sparked fire as she stared fearlessly at the
monster who stood beside her.
</p>

<p>
Toutou was in a different mood from any I knew, or,
rather, I should say, from the one I knew.  His sinisterly
beautiful face revealed the latent ferocity that was the
salient feature of his character, but with it there was
something else, something difficult to define.  The tigerish
glare in his eyes was replaced by a softer light; the pupils
were expanded.  His mouth was slack.  His movements
were uncertain.  He hovered over Betty, looking almost
fearfully at Hélène.
</p>

<p>
She stood just inside the door that communicated with
the large outer chamber.  She was dressed in a sport suit
and high boots.  Her hat was off, and her face showed
pinched and wan.  There were shadows under her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Say I am jealous," she answered steadily.  "I have a
right to be.  You have never had a woman who did more
for you than I.  Do you think Miss Innocence here would
do what I have done?"
</p>

<p>
"That is why I want her," returned Toutou, his voice
singularly hoarse.  "I am tired of you.  I am tired of all
of you.  I hunger for innocence.  I wish to forget crime
and evil.  When we finish this job I am going to take this
petite and go away where Toutou will be unknown."
</p>

<p>
"Toutou LaFitte a reformed character!" Hélène laughed
sarcastically.  "You don't know what you are talking
about.  You have nothing in common with innocence."
</p>

<p>
"Who knows?"
</p>

<p>
"I know, mon ami.  The girl would kill herself first.
Sooner than see you do this, I will kill you."
</p>

<p>
Toutou frowned at her.
</p>

<p>
"Stand back!" he warned.  "If you touch her&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hélène stepped forward boldly, one hand inside her
jacket.
</p>

<p>
"There are many things you can do, Toutou," she said.
"And you are chief.  Nobody questions that.  But remember
that if the others are afraid of you, I am not.  And
I say that you shall not do this.  Something you owe to the
band.  More, still, you owe to me.  You know me well
enough to appreciate that I intend to secure what I
consider due me."
</p>

<p>
Toutou growled in his throat, and his pupils began to
contract.  The slack look left his mouth.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"It is time you feared me," he snarled.  "Go away, I
am through with you.  I never wish to see you again.  You
shall have your share of this coup, then you shall leave
the band."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought there was to be no more band," sneered
Hélène.  "I thought Toutou was to become an honest
bourgeois, with a dove-cot&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You shall feel my knife," he barked at her.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I fear your knife?" she retorted.  "The
last time a woman threatened you, you fled from her
knife."
</p>

<p>
Her face was white with rage, and Toutou's whole frame
seemed to draw together as an animal does when it
prepares to spring.  His long arms curved before him, his
right hand at the level of his belt.
</p>

<p>
"You do not know when a man tires of you, it seems,"
he exclaimed.  "Can you not see we wish to be by ourselves?"
</p>

<p>
She made a violent effort to regain her self-control.
</p>

<p>
"For the last time," she said quietly, "will you heed the
opinion of your colleagues and leave this girl alone?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he growled savagely.  "Go, you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look out," cried Betty, who alone of us all could see
clearly what Toutou was doing with his right hand.  "His
knife!"
</p>

<p>
Hélène snatched a pistol from her blouse; but he was
too quick for her.  As the flame spurted from the barrel
he leaped aside, and his immensely long arm curled out
and slashed down.  The blood frothed over the hilt of his
knife as it clicked on her collar-bone, and she dropped,
choking, to the floor.
</p>

<p>
In the same instant Hugh fired, but one of us jostled
him and the bullet missed.  Toutou turned, saw the curtain
swaying as we charged, and ran for the door.  I fired
once, and the bullet chipped between his arm and side,
but he was out before we could shoot again.
</p>

<p>
From the courtyard came a crash and a ripple of shots
that vied with the thunder.  A chorus of yells pierced
thinly the howling of the gale.
</p>

<p>
Nikka, hearing Hélène's pistol, had accepted it as the
long over-due signal for his attack.
</p>

<p>
"Take care of Betty, Professor!" Hugh called to King.
"See if you can help this poor girl.  Come on, Jack,
Watty!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br /><br />
THE RECKONING
</h3>

<p>
The big room was a maze of shadows.  Stable-lanterns,
flickering in the drafts, hung from hooks
in walls and pillars.  Toutou stayed his flight by
the door to the courtyard, one ear inclined to the bedlam
of shots and outcries that threaded the roar of the storm.
As we burst in he raised a pistol and sprayed us with
bullets as rapidly as he could pull the trigger.  But he had
the knife-fighter's inability to shoot straight.  Bullets
"phutted" all around us, yet none of us was hit.
</p>

<p>
Several men and women stared at us.  Hilmi Bey peered
from behind a pillar next the courtyard door.  He had
plainly taken shelter at the crack of Hélène's pistol.
Montey Hilyer and Serge Vassilievich stood some distance
to the right of us, paralyzed with surprise.  Maude Hilyer
and Sandra Vassilievna had risen from seats in the
apse-like recess at the other end.  Apparently they had
supposed Toutou was engaged only with Hélène.
</p>

<p>
He screamed at them, insensate in his fury.  His
knife still dripped blood.  He flung his empty pistol at
us.
</p>

<p>
"Fools!" he shrieked.  "We are betrayed!"
</p>

<p>
The door to the courtyard was jerked open, and he spun
on his heel and dodged behind a pillar.  Tokalji reeled
in.
</p>

<p>
"Strange Tzigane folk have burst the street-door," he
bellowed.  "We&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He gaped at sight of us.
</p>

<p>
"Quick!" Hugh shouted.  "Scatter&mdash;before they shoot!"
</p>

<p>
Watkins and I jumped right and left.  Hugh sought the
shelter of a pillar.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot!" yelled Toutou.  "Shoot!  Fools!  Swine!  Dogs!"
</p>

<p>
And he babbled on obscenely, darting catlike from pillar
to pillar toward Watty.  Hilyer and Serge simultaneously
came to life and made for us, guns spurting, throwing
pieces of furniture to confuse us.  Things happened so
fast that it was impossible to keep track of everything,
but I found myself involved in a pistol duel with Serge.
Hugh and Watkins were blazing away at Hilmi, Hilyer
and Tokalji, and Toutou was weaving through the smoke,
seeking an opportunity to close with one of us.  I paid
no attention to the women until a bullet spatted on a pillar
by my ear.  I knew it could not have come from the front,
and startled, I turned to the left in time to see Sandra
aiming deliberately at me.  I dodged, and thereby opened
myself to her brother's attack.
</p>

<p>
He was an excellent marksman, and I realized there
could be only one result for me if I continued exposed in
flank.  So I tore a lantern from its hook and flung it on
the floor.  The burning oil vomited forth a cloud of thick
black smoke, and under cover of this, I changed my position,
gaining the protection of another pillar.  Here I was
safe from Sandra; but her brother knew where I was and
our duel continued.  It was no steady stream of bullets,
but a pot-shot whenever one of us thought he saw an
opportunity.  All around us others were doing the same
thing, and the vaulted roof rang to the reports, while the
acrid fumes of the powder and the smoke from broken
lamps stung the eyes.  And outside the thunder was
pealing and the lightning splitting the heavens and Nikka's
men and Tokalji's Gypsies were trying their feeble best
to rival nature's forces.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, I sensed that our opponents were bracing for
a combined effort.  There was a rapid-fire exchange of
exclamations in the thieves' French and Tzigane dialect
they used for confidential communication.  I heard an
empty cartridge-clip jingle on the floor.  But in the
shifting light and smoke it was impossible now to tell real men
from the shadows.  I stuck my head around a pillar,
crouched and slipped aside.  Then, while I was
unprotected, the rush came.
</p>

<p>
"Go!" called Hilyer's voice.
</p>

<p>
The shadows were pricked with pistol-flashes.  Serge
Vassilievich leaped for the pillar behind which I had
stood, his gun blazing, knife in hand.  He did not see me,
on my knees, four feet to the right, and I put my first
bullet in his thigh.  He stopped as if a giant's hand had
been shoved against his breast, tottered and fell backward.
As he fell, one of the burning oil-pools ignited a
bundle of blankets, and the rising flames sketched us both
clearly against the darkness that shrouded the far end of
the room.
</p>

<p>
There was a scream.  I recognized Sandra's voice, but
I could not see her.  Instead, I saw Hilmi Bey sneaking
on Watkins, who was holding back Toutou.  I drove the
Levantine away with my first shot.  Then the hammer
clicked, and I knew the magazine was empty.  I dropped
to my knee again, thinking I was concealed by a patch
of shadow, and fumbled for a fresh clip.  But the
treacherous light flared upward, the shadow disappeared
and I was left defenseless.  I saw a raging figure, hair
flying, pistol raised, running at me.  I saw the pistol
flash, felt a numbing blow on my left shoulder and
tumbled in a heap.
</p>

<p>
For a second my eyes misted, the room danced before
me.  Then I heard a chatter of Russian and Watkins,
mildly disapproving.
</p>

<p>
"None of that 'ere, miss.  If you please, now!  I don't
want to 'urt you, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I looked up.  Sandra, her face contorted with demoniac
rage, her empty pistol shaking in her hand, was backing
away before Watty's menacing crowbar.
</p>

<p>
A woman screamed again, horribly, so that it rasped
your heart-strings.  It was Maude Hilyer.  She stood, with
hands clutching her cheeks, her gaze fixed on the center
of the room where Montey staggered against a pillar,
the blood from a punctured lung gurgling in his throat,
bravely trying for the last time to raise the smoking muzzle
of his automatic.
</p>

<p>
Hugh, relieved of the Englishman's attack, was taking
pot-shots at Toutou and Hilmi.  I saw Tokalji slip
through the door into the rain, and as Vernon King ran
up the stairs from the atrium Hilmi followed the Tzigane
and Toutou jumped through a window, squawling like the
big cat he was.  Behind me Watkins was scientifically
roping Sandra, hand and foot, regardless of the curses she
spat in three languages.  Vassilievich had fainted from
the pain of his wound.  Maude Hilyer sat on the dirty
floor, under the single wobbling lantern that remained
intact, and cradled the head of her dying husband.  We
had swept the House of the Married.
</p>

<p>
Or had we?  As I tried unsuccessfully with one hand to
reload my pistol, I felt a pressure on my back.  I turned
and very nearly impaled myself on a long knife-blade.  A
tense, willowy figure, bare-footed and tumble-haired, stood
over me.
</p>

<p>
"You are Jakka," said Kara in the Tzigane dialect&mdash;I
could understand simple phrases after my experience with
Nikka's tribespeople.  "Where is Nikka?"
</p>

<p>
Dumbfounded, I pointed to the courtyard.  She glided
toward the door, but Hugh intervened.
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast," he said.  "Whose friend are you?"
</p>

<p>
She did not understand him, and raised her knife.
</p>

<p>
"I'll shoot you, if you are a girl," warned Hugh.  "Any
one who resists&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She's all right, Hugh," I called.  "She's trying to
find Nikka&mdash;must have been asleep upstairs.  Let her go."
</p>

<p>
But she did not wait for him to stand aside.  With a
single leap, she put one of the pillars between him and
herself, and vaulted from the window Toutou had escaped by.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing slow about that girl," said Hugh.  "Everybody whole?"
</p>

<p>
A pistol cracked in the doorway, and the bullet sang by
his ear.
</p>

<p>
"They're still after us," he commented, dropping beside
me.  "Have to load my gun."
</p>

<p>
"Then load mine, too," I said.  "My left shoulder's
hit&mdash;whole arm is no use."
</p>

<p>
He laid down his automatic.
</p>

<p>
"We'll carry you inside with Betty.  I see Watty has
made a prisoner, and Vassilievich had better be watched.
You can&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I will not," I returned.  "We'll need every man before
we finish to-night.  Hear that!"
</p>

<p>
The courtyard had become an inferno&mdash;yells, screams,
howls, shots, the beat of the rain and the din of the storm.
</p>

<p>
"Tie my arm to my side, and I'll be O.K.," I urged.
</p>

<p>
Betty crawled between us.
</p>

<p>
"Did I hear you call me?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"My word!" grunted Hugh.  "Get back, Bet.  This is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Touch and go," she supplemented his sentence.  "I
have Hélène's gun.  You boys had better help Nikka.  I
can guard this place."
</p>

<p>
A whistle shrilled in the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh!"  It was Nikka's voice.  "Jack!"
</p>

<p>
There was a racket of shots.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he must be badly outnumbered," muttered Hugh.
"No time to lose.  Here, Jack, where's your handkerchief?
Right O!  Thanks, Bet.  Not too tight.  Can you stand
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, load my gun, somebody."
</p>

<p>
Betty took it.  King, ensconced behind an adjacent pillar,
fired at the door.
</p>

<p>
"They seem to be waiting for us out there," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh.  "Betty, you lie here in the shadows.
Don't let anybody approach you, no matter what they
say.  Keep an eye on Mrs. Hilyer and the Russian girl&mdash;and
her brother.  See him over there?  He's done in, for
the time-being, but if he comes to maybe you'd better tie
him up."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you worry about me," answered Betty valiantly.
"I can take care of myself.  Do hurry!"
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, your ludship," came a throaty whisper from
Watkins.  "This way, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
He was at the far end of the room, and while we watched,
he put his hat on the end of his crowbar&mdash;from which he
refused to be parted&mdash;and stuck it above the sill of a
window.
</p>

<p>
"I've done this twice now, your ludship," he
added, "and nothing's 'appened.  They ain't watching
'ere."
</p>

<p>
A little investigation proved that he was right, and we
crawled out into the rain and huddled against the
house-wall, attempting to disentangle the situation.  The rain
was descending in slanting, blinding sheets.  Pistols
cracked and men gasped or shouted, but we could not tell
whether they were friends or foes.  As we waited, two
men dashed by, one in pursuit of the other.  It was
impossible for us to intervene.  Then, with a preliminary
crash of thunder, the lightning zigzagged across the sky,
and for the winking of an eye the courtyard was bright
as day.
</p>

<p>
I had an impression of bodies scattered here and there,
and little clusters of men that struggled and ran.  Over
in the corner of the courtyard wall by the bachelors' house
men swirled in a tumultuous mass.  The darkness closed
down once more, thick and wet and cold.
</p>

<p>
"Coming, Nikka!" shouted Hugh.  And to us: "The
big fight is the key to everything.  We must break it up.
They've got Nikka pinned in."
</p>

<p>
Tokalji's gang faced around as we attacked their rear;
but we went clean through them and almost drove on to the
knives of Nikka's party.
</p>

<p>
"After them!" panted Hugh.  "We've got 'em breaking!"
</p>

<p>
Nikka called to his men in their own tongue, and they
lined up with us in a thin file across the courtyard from
wall to wall.  Behind Nikka I had a brief vision of a figure
as elusive as the rain.  I thought of an assassin who had
flanked us and lifted my automatic&mdash;but something, the
proud poise of the head, perhaps, warned me it was
Kara.
</p>

<p>
There was a crackle of pistol-fire in front of us, and a
knot of figures swayed into view, distorted, indistinct.
The deluge seemed to act as a freak lens to play tricks
with normal vision; and possibly that was why comparatively
few were shot.  Twice I had men fair over the barrel
of my pistol, and both times I missed&mdash;and I am rather
better than a good shot.  But I had no opportunity for
philosophizing at that time.
</p>

<p>
Toutou and Hilmi Bey went for Nikka.  He was bleeding
from a cut in the arm, and all his men were engaged.
Hugh, with King and Watty, was developing an encircling
movement on the opposite end of the line.  I started to go
to Nikka's aid, but a man sprang at me from nowhere, and
I was obliged to dodge him until I had a chance to shoot,
I did not miss that time.  When I looked again, Nikka and
Toutou were circling each other, and Hilmi was at grips
with Kara.
</p>

<p>
At first I thought the Levantine was scheming to throw
the girl, but as I drew near I perceived that he had clinched
with her in mortal terror of her knife.  She held his own
powerless by her grasp of his wrist.  A mocking light
gleamed in her eyes, and she shook back her loose hair and
jeered at him in the Tzigane dialect.  With one pudgy
hand he strove to ward off her blade, but he could not
control her lithe muscles.  She tore her wrist free, the
steel drove home through his sodden frock-coat and he
collapsed with a squeal.
</p>

<p>
Kara pulled out her knife as casually as though it had
been a familiar occurrence, and turned to watch Nikka's
fight with Toutou.  Nikka from the corner of his eye
saw the two of us, plainly waiting a chance to help him,
and he leaped clear of the circle of his enemy's knife long
enough to snap:
</p>

<p>
"Let be!  I finish this alone!"
</p>

<p>
I couldn't have helped him, in any case, for as redoubtable
a person as Tokalji, himself, attacked me that moment.
Kara did not even notice my danger.  She also ignored the
man she called father.  Her whole attention was concentrated
upon Nikka.  I fired once at the Gypsy chief, and
missed.  That was the last cartridge in the magazine, and
I attempted to lose him in the rain.  But he refused to be
lost, and I was making up my mind to taking his knife
in my wounded arm and battering his head with my pistol-butt,
when Watkins loomed in the mist and brought down
his trusty crowbar on Tokalji's knife-wrist.  The Gypsy
yelped like a dog, and the knife clattered on the ground.
Watty produced some rope from a pocket and deftly
twisted the man's arms behind him.  Tokalji yelped again.
</p>

<p>
"Easy," I said.  "The fellow's wrist is broken."
</p>

<p>
"I'm tying 'im above the helbows, Mister Jack, sir,"
answered Watty.  "But if it did 'urt 'im a bit I wouldn't
worry, sir.  I 'ave an hidea, sir, 'e was one of the
scoundrels that bashed me 'ead."
</p>

<p>
My one thought was of Nikka, and I sought him over the
rain-battered area of the court.  The fighting had drifted
away toward the sea-wall.  There seemed to be nobody
near me.  I listened hard, and in a lull of the storm my
ears detected the click of blades.  I stumbled toward it,
and nearly fell on top of Kara, crouching as I had left
her, eyes glued on the two men who circled tirelessly,
steel-tipped arms crooked before them.
</p>

<p>
Toutou had a huge advantage in reach, but Nikka had
the benefit of lithe agility, a wrist of iron&mdash;the result of
years of bowing; a hawk's eyes; and all the tricks with
the blade that the people of his race have amassed in
centuries of bloody strife.  Four times, while I watched,
Toutou endeavored to force down Nikka's knife by the
sheer strength of his gorilla-arm, and each time Nikka
disengaged and refused to give the opportunity his
adversary needed.  Twice Nikka tried a certain trick, a
combination of lightning thrusts and clever footwork.  But
the Frenchman parried it each time, and retaliated so
quickly as to drive Nikka out of reach.
</p>

<p>
Neither of them said anything.  Toutou spat and whined
in his throat, cat-fashion.  Nikka panted from the exertion.
Both of them dripped with sweat, notwithstanding the
rain.  There was something of an epic quality about their
struggle, and I discovered myself taking the same almost
impersonal interest in it that Kara demonstrated.  By
all the principles of normal right-behavior, I should have
ignored Nikka's command to let him fight it out alone,
and rushed in at the first opening to kill a monster, who
did not deserve and had no appreciation of knightly
treatment.  But I could not.  I was chained by an emotion
I could not fathom.
</p>

<p>
And yet I was absorbed in Nikka's success.  My heart
leaped in my throat when I saw that he was trying for the
third time the trick which had twice failed.  His knife
went up in the same way, he shifted posture as he had in
his other tries, and Toutou mechanically side-stepped as
experience had told him was safe and aimed a stab which
should have cut Nikka's throat.  But Nikka was not there.
He had varied the trick.  Stooping, his knife had fallen,
then sliced upward&mdash;and Toutou staggered, a look of bland
surprise on his face, ripped open from belly to chest.
</p>

<p>
"Pt-sss-ss-tss-sst!" he hissed, and fell forward.
</p>

<p>
Kara hurled herself into Nikka's arms.
</p>

<p>
"You are the greatest knife-fighter of the Tziganes!"
she cried triumphantly.  "You are a king!  You are my
man!  See, while you conquered your enemy, I, too, stabbed
the rat who tried to put his knife in your back."
</p>

<p>
And she led Nikka to the body of Hilmi, which, I regret
to say, she kicked with her brown toes.  Nikka absent-mindedly
leaned over to wipe his knife on the Levantine's
coat-tails, but Kara intervened.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," she exclaimed.  "Here is my hair!  Wipe it
on my hair, beloved of my heart.  Let me suck it clean
with my lips!  So we shall have strong sons."
</p>

<p>
Nikka looked sufficiently annoyed to show that he had
some instincts of civilization remaining.
</p>

<p>
"Peace," he ordered royally.  "Be quiet, girl!"
</p>

<p>
She cowered before him, and he recognized me.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hullo, Jack!  Where's Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh loomed through the rain as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"That you, Nikka?  We think we've got Tokalji's people
rounded up, but we need you to talk to them.  Has
Toutou&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's there."
</p>

<p>
Nikka pointed his knife to the heap of drab garments
that had been the French "killer."
</p>

<p>
"Good for you!" exclaimed Hugh.  "I'm glad he didn't
get off.  When you think of Uncle James and&mdash;that girl
we saw&mdash;and I suppose others!  What a beast!"
</p>

<p>
We splashed after him, Kara following Nikka like a
dog.  Wasso Mikali, his surviving young men, King and
Watkins were guarding thirteen shivering Gypsies in the
lee of the bachelors' quarters.  In reply to questions,
Tokalji told Nikka&mdash;and Kara, shamelessly throwing in
her lot with us, corroborated him&mdash;that there had been
fifteen of their band on the premises.  A search of the
courtyard disclosed two of them dead, together with one
of Wasso Mikali's men.  We bound the arms of the prisoners,
most of whom were suffering from bullet-wounds or
stabs, and marched them over to the House of the Married.
</p>

<p>
The one lantern was still flickering when we entered,
and Betty rose to greet us.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" she said soberly as her eyes envisaged
us all.  "What did you do with Mrs. Hilyer?"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't she here?" asked Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I don't know just when she left.  There was a lot
of firing, and I looked to where she had been sitting by
her husband, and she was gone."
</p>

<p>
Nikka and I sped back into the courtyard.  We picked
our way over the occasional bodies to the street-door.
It was ajar.
</p>

<p>
"I locked it myself!" cried Nikka.  "Old Wasso
picked it without damaging the spring.  I took time
when we entered to fasten it again."
</p>

<p>
I was feeling very weak.  My shoulder throbbed.
Nausea assailed me in recurrent waves.  But I clutched
the gate-post, and peered into the street.  Nobody was in
sight.  Sokaki Masyeri was a bare waste of mud and
foaming gutters.
</p>

<p>
"She escaped," said Nikka.  "Too bad!  We might
have&mdash;  What's the matter, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
He caught me as my knees bent under me.  I felt the
rain on my eyelids, and then everything was blotted
out.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
UNDER THE RED STONE
</h3>

<p>
When I opened my eyes Watkins was bending
over me.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there, Mister Jack," he said, "'ave a
drink of this.  Thank you, sir."  And as I struggled to
a sitting position: "No need of 'aste, sir.  All's well.
And you 'ad a bit of a knock, if I may say so, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It seems as though you and I were the Jonahs, Watty,"
I answered.  "This is the third time I've passed out cold.
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, sir.  The same thought was in me own
'ead.  If Mrs. Prouty and 'Awkins&mdash;the butler, sir&mdash;and
the others in the Servants' 'All could 'ave seen me last
night, they would 'ave been startled, sir.  I do assure you
they would.  There was that Russian young lady, now.
I give you my word, sir, she cursed like a maniac, and
'er brother was no better when 'e came from 'is faint.  A
fair rowdy lot of people we 'ad on our 'ands&mdash;including
the young person in whom Mister Nikka happears to be
interested, as the saying goes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You said 'last night,' I believe," I interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  It's close to noon, Mister Jack.  But Lord
bless you, sir, there's been no rest.  We 'ad a largish
hundertaker's job, let alone tidying up and minding the
prisoners."
</p>

<p>
"What have we done with the bodies?"
</p>

<p>
"In the garden, sir.  The prisoners did the work&mdash;except
the Russian persons, sir.  'E couldn't, account of 'is
leg, and she, being a lady, so to speak, was hexcused."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to get up," I announced.  "My shoulder
feels better."
</p>

<p>
"If you wish, sir.  Miss Betty thought you would be
fit after a nap.  She and Mister Nikka's uncle, the tall
old gentleman who looks like Pantaloon in the Drury Lane
pantos, they looked you over.  They said your shoulder
bone was bruised and the muscle torn, sir; but they've
wrapped you up to the king's taste.  My instructions were
to get you anything you required, but with submission, sir,
might I suggest you sleep a little longer?  There's
nothing&mdash;oh, 'ere's Mister Nikka."
</p>

<p>
Nikka strolled in from the courtyard&mdash;I was lying in
the apse at the end of the large chamber on the ground
floor of the House of the Married&mdash;with Kara trailing him.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Jack!" he greeted me.  "Tough luck you had
to stop a bullet.  We're all more or less cut up, but you
had the worst of it, although my uncle, who is a practical
surgeon in a crude way, claims the bullet missed the
bone."
</p>

<p>
"So Watkins told me.  Any news?  The police&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, the storm covered the shooting.  Hugh has been to
Pera with Betty in the <i>Curlew</i> this morning, and they
heard no comments.  One of Wasso Mikali's men stopped
in at the corner coffee-shop, and made sure there was no
local gossip.  The only danger, I think, is from Mrs. Hilyer.
We've got to risk that."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you all worn out?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Too much excitement, I expect.  We're just going
to eat.  Then Betty insists on going after the treasure
again."
</p>

<p>
Kara sidled up to him, with a venomous glance at me,
and ejaculated a remark sotto voice.  Nikka laughed, and
pushed her behind him.  She heeded him like a dog that
is contented with a rebuke, so long as notice is taken by
its master.
</p>

<p>
"She said," Nikka translated, "that I ought not to
talk with you any longer.  She wants me to pay
attention to her."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" I growled, returning Kara's look with
interest.  "Help me up, will you?  Thanks!  What are you
going to do with her?"
</p>

<p>
"Tame her, I expect," he answered cheerfully.  "I've
begun by taking her knife away from her.  She wanted to
stick Betty because I talked more than five minutes to Bet
about you."
</p>

<p>
"A sweet job!  She'll end by sticking you."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," agreed Nikka equably.  "Come and get
some breakfast.  A cup of coffee will help you to take a
more charitable view of a wild little Gypsy girl."
</p>

<p>
Hugh, Betty and Vernon King welcomed us as we entered
the atrium, where a low table of packing-boxes had
been rigged.  Wasso Mikali and his men were either
guarding the prisoners or else keeping watch on the street
entrance.  Kara scowled at all of us, but squatted
determinedly behind Nikka.  Watkins proceeded to serve, and
I was amused to observe that Kara, much against her
will, was secretly awed by the matter-of-fact pomp with
which Watkins was able to invest a meal under such
impromptu conditions.
</p>

<p>
We talked very little.  The one idea in the mind of
each of us was to get at the red stone, which we could see
from where we sat, and we choked down our food as rapidly
as possible.  I forgot completely my injured shoulder.
Watkins actually hurried himself in passing the eggs.
Betty and Hugh crumbled a few bits of toast, and strangled
over their coffee.  Vernon King alone ate placidly, with
the zest of a man who feels he has done a good job well.
At last, Betty could stand it no longer, and she sprang up
with an imitation of Kara's scowl so faithful that
everybody, except Kara, laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy, you've had time for two breakfasts," she
decreed.  "That's enough.  Besides, I won't have you
getting fat in your old age.  Come!  Everybody!  We've got
our chance, our chance that we began to think was gone
aglimmering.  The treasure of the Bucoleon is at our
feet&mdash;under our feet, I mean.  Up with the red stone!"
</p>

<p>
"Up she goes!" assented Hugh.
</p>

<p>
Crowbars, chisels, mallets, picks and shovels appeared,
and Hugh paced the distance from the Fountain of the
Lion.  His calculations indicated the stone that I had
roughly estimated on our first visit to the garden.  We all
watched him with madly beating hearts.  It was really
true!  We were going to lay bare the secret covered by
the red stone, to grasp the prize that the Emperor
Andronicus had concealed seven centuries before, the prize
that generation after generation of men had striven for in
vain.
</p>

<p>
The thought exhilarated us, and when Hugh stepped
aside and seized a chisel and mallet we all set to with
superhuman energy.  I was unable to do much, but I
experienced a sharp pleasure in the mere act of holding with
my one hand the head of a chisel upon which one of the
others rained blows with a mallet.  We could not take
time for conversation.  We worked.  Even Vernon King,
who had millions at his command, succumbed to the lure
of the red stone's secret, and panted as he chipped the
rotten mortar from the interstices between the red stone
and those surrounding it.
</p>

<p>
Working at such a pace and with so many willing hands,
it was only a matter of a few minutes before the stone
was detached from its neighbors, and Nikka thrust the tip
of a crowbar under its edge.  Followed then a struggle
of some duration, but in the end it sagged up and was
overturned.  Below it was a second stone of equal
dimensions, granite, unmortared, although the dust of ages had
sifted into the cracks around it.  This yielded to our
efforts much sooner than had the cap-stone, and Hugh,
kneeling amongst the debris, peered down into a yawning
hole in the pavement.
</p>

<p>
"Careful!" warned King.  "A compartment which has
been sealed for centuries will be full of carbonic-acid
gas."
</p>

<p>
Hugh sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"It's as damp as&mdash;as&mdash;that beastly drain," he said.
"But it smells reasonably sweet."
</p>

<p>
We poked our torches into the hole.  All they showed
was a steep flight of stairs descending straight into
blackness.
</p>

<p>
"Most extraordinary!" mumbled Vernon King.  "Byzantine
masonry, beyond a doubt.  Observe the squaring
of the blocks, and the composition of the mortar.  This
is no such slovenly work as Turkish masons do.  The
master-builders of old laid these stones."
</p>

<p>
"If it's safe, what are we waiting for?" I barked.
</p>

<p>
Our nerves were on edge.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, take your time," said Hugh impatiently, and he
lowered himself, feet first.
</p>

<p>
The others followed him, one by one, and I brought up
the rear, ashamed of myself for the temper I had
exhibited.  The pitch of the stairs was so sharp that we had
to bend only a little in passing under the rim of the
opening.  They were barely wide enough for one man, and I
counted thirty of them before they terminated in a passage
that led off at right angles, with an appreciable
downward slope.
</p>

<p>
"Hold up!" Hugh called back to us a moment later.
"Here's an opening into another passage.  There's a step
down.  Why, this is the drain again!"
</p>

<p>
We joined him, incredulous, only to be convinced at
once that he was right.  The passage debouched on the
sewer some distance inland from the grating of the
dungeon.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" groaned Hugh.  "And we've gone through
everything for this!  Was there ever such a sell!"
</p>

<p>
The vaulted roof echoed his words.  The "drip-drip"
of slime and fungi was a melancholy punctuation for
them.  But the reaction loosened our taut nerves.  The
one thought of all of us was to comfort Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"There may be some explanation," said Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we overlooked something," I volunteered.
</p>

<p>
"It is a most unusual archæological discovery," offered
King.
</p>

<p>
"There is an explanation," cried Betty.  "We have
overlooked something.  I know it.  There must be."
</p>

<p>
"It's no go," answered Hugh despondently.  "I've
brought you on a wild-goose chase."
</p>

<p>
We all looked rather white and wan in the cold light
of the electric torches.
</p>

<p>
"It's not your fault, old man," I said after a moment's
silence, trying dismally to be cheerful.  "The lead looked
good.  We followed it because we hoped it would make
you rich.  We failed, and that's that."
</p>

<p>
Betty stared wildly from one to the other of us.
</p>

<p>
"You all make me tired," she exclaimed.  "Why should
we give up hope?  How long have we looked, so far?
What&mdash;  Oh, let me by!  I must think!"
</p>

<p>
She brushed by me into the fake passage, and the echo
of her footfalls reached us as she ascended to the garden.
</p>

<p>
"We might as well follow her," said Hugh.  "I'm awfully
sorry, you chaps.  You risked your lives for this
rotten show.  My poor deluded ancestor!  I expect most
of these buried treasure stories are bunk, anyway.  In
fact, I have a dim recollection of telling poor Uncle James
as much.  And there's another thing to make the gods
laugh!  A fine old cock like Uncle James devoting his
whole life to following a will-o'-the-wisp&mdash;and then losing
it for nothing.  It&mdash;it's&mdash;oh, Hell, I suppose it's really
funny!"
</p>

<p>
We climbed wearily up the thirty steps to the garden
level.  As I reached the surface the first object my eyes
encountered was Betty, sitting on the red stone and
poring over a sheet of paper.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" she called, looking up with all her accustomed
vivacity.  "Do you recognize this paper, Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
She fluttered it at him.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like my handwriting," he admitted.
</p>

<p>
"It's the copy of the Instructions you sent me, which
I remailed to myself Poste Restante.  I remembered it
this morning when we were in Pera and called for it at
the Post Office while you were packing the bags at the
hotel.  I thought we might need it."
</p>

<p>
"What good can it do?" asked Hugh heavily.
</p>

<p>
"There's an important point in it, which nobody has
appreciated up to this time.  It becomes doubly important
in view of what we have just seen."
</p>

<p>
"The elided portion!" exclaimed Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly!  Look!"
</p>

<p>
And she spread the paper before us.  Hugh had faithfully
copied his uncle's translation of the old Latin, setting
down also the several lines of dots by which Lord
Chesby had indicated the words which had been smudged
out by moisture and handling at some past time.  They
appeared, you will recall, at the conclusion of the explicit
directions:
</p>

<p>
"Underfoot is a red stone an ell square.  Raise the&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And then nothing distinguishable until the concluding
line of farewell.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" demanded Betty triumphantly as we all studied
the cryptic dots.
</p>

<p>
Hugh shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Betty, you were a brick to remember it," he said, "but
honestly, what use is it?  Whatever words are missing are
unimportant.  They must have been or somebody would
have rewritten them."
</p>

<p>
"That does not necessarily follow," spoke up Vernon
King.  "Old documents, especially those inscribed on
parchment, are tricky records.  It frequently happens that
some isolated portion will be spoiled, while the other parts
of the same sheet may retain their integrity.  Moreover,
we should not lose sight of the possibility that the person
who last concealed the parchment, the Lady Jane Chesby
of whom you have spoken, seems not to have been inclined
to attach much importance to it.  She would have been
the last one to attempt to make good its deficiencies."
</p>

<p>
"But where could the treasure be that we have not
looked?" demanded Hugh.  "The directions are explicit.
We followed them faithfully.  So far as they exist we
have verified their accuracy.  But we have uncovered no
place which could have served as a treasure chamber."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Hugh, the directions are explicit," retorted Betty.
"And as you say, so far as we have them they have proved
correct.  They left us in the passage under the red stone
which ends at the drain.  And why was that passage
built?  Why to get into the drain!"
</p>

<p>
"And the treasure was in the drain?" protested Hugh.
"That's absurd, Bet."
</p>

<p>
"It would have been washed away long ago," I scoffed.
"That place is full of water at very high tides."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say it was heaped on the floor and left there,"
returned Betty.
</p>

<p>
"Where would it be?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"That's what we have to find out."
</p>

<p>
"What about the grating in the floor of the dungeon?"
I cut in.  "If they wanted to get into the drain&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But no man who had hidden a treasure in the drain
would have relied on a drainage grating in a dungeon for
means of access to it," answered Betty.
</p>

<p>
"That dungeon was a place for getting rid of special
prisoners," interrupted King.  "When the drain was
actively in use, the water must often have backed up into the
dungeon.  I agree with Elizabeth that an Emperor hiding
a vast treasure would not have utilized the grating
for access to it."
</p>

<p>
Nikka closed the argument.
</p>

<p>
"I am on Betty's side in this," he said.  "At the least,
she has given us something definite to work on.  Now, if
you will take my advice, Hugh, you and Professor King,
with Betty and Jack to help you, will be the treasure-hunting
squad.  I had best remain here to act as expeditionary
liaison officer with Wasso Mikali and his people
at need.  And if you don't mind, I'll need Watkins as
galloper."
</p>

<p>
Every one agreed to this plan, and the four of us
immediately descended into the passage again.  King made
a careful study of the stonework, in which I assisted him,
with a view to ascertaining beyond any doubt whether
there was any sealed opening in its walls.  Both of us
considered this the logical first step, but Hugh and Betty
wearied of so unexciting a task and left us to explore
the upper end of the drain.
</p>

<p>
We had been at this for rather more than an hour, without
the faintest hint of success, when we were interrupted
by a hail from Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Professor!  Jack!  Come here!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dad," called Betty, "here's a funny inscription
on the wall."
</p>

<p>
We dropped into the water, and waded inland for some
twenty-odd paces to where they were standing, with their
torches bearing on a patch of marble let into the rough
face of the right-hand wall.  Hugh was working with his
knife-point, scraping away the moss and fungi that
partially obscured the letters.
</p>

<p>
"I saw it by accident," bubbled Betty.  "We went up
a long way to where the roof gets much lower, and we
heard water rushing ahead of us, so Hugh said we ought
to turn back.  My light just happened to catch on this
piece of stone here as we passed it.  There was one row
of letters quite clear, but the others were all overgrown
with this slimy stuff.  What does it say, Dad?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Greek right enough," added Hugh, still scraping
industriously.  "I can make out a word here and there,
but it doesn't seem to be the same language I boned at
school.  Just a moment, sir, and I'll have the whole
inscription cleared."
</p>

<p>
I peered over their shoulders at the deeply-carven lines
of angular characters.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-276"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-276.jpg" alt="Inscribed stone" />
</p>

<p>
The stone was about three or four feet square, and
below it was another similar one.  Above the lettering was
an elaborately scrolled cross.  From it my eyes sought my
uncle's face, and were held at once by the astonishment
I saw mirrored there.
</p>

<p>
"Most amazing!" he muttered to himself.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Dad?" clamored Betty.
</p>

<p>
"But it can't be," he said, shaking his head.  "Quite
extraordinary!  Dear me, I never saw this formula before."
</p>




<p>
"For Pat's sake, tell us!" I implored.
</p>

<p>
"It says nothing about the treasure, my dear boys,"
he answered sadly.  "My surprise was called forth by
the unusual form of expression.  These inscriptions
always follow a certain set phraseology, but this one is
strikingly different."
</p>

<p>
"By gum," groaned Betty inelegantly.  "Isn't this the
limit?"
</p>

<p>
"Read it anyway," I urged.
</p>

<p>
Hugh was beyond words.
</p>

<p>
"It says," began King, "and mind you, I am translating
roughly&mdash;your statement that it differs from the
classical Greek, standardized according to German theories,
Hugh, such as is taught in the classroom, is quite correct&mdash;'In
the year after Christ 1185 and of the Indiction 2,
Andronicus, the Scepter Wielder, Christ-loving Emperor
of the Romans, built this drain new from the tide level.'"
</p>

<p>
He broke off.
</p>

<p>
"So far it is no different from thousands of other
inscriptions we might find on the city walls, aqueducts,
cisterns, churches or other public works.  But now comes
the part I cannot understand: 'If there were tongues,
many might praise him."
</p>

<p>
"'If there were tongues many might praise him,'"
repeated Betty.
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter?" said Hugh dispiritedly.
"We're not interested in whether or not the subjects of
the Emperor Andronicus were anxious to praise him.  I
could curse him for putting up a cock-and-bull story on
my foolish ancestor.'
</p>

<p>
"'If there were tongues many might praise him,'"
repeated Betty again.  "And it was the Emperor Andronicus!
The same, Daddy?  The one the Instructions speak
about?"
</p>

<p>
"Manifestly, my dear, the date certifies to that."
</p>

<p>
"Then there must be something in it," she insisted.
"'If there were tongues many might praise him.'  Don't
you see what it means?  There were no tongues to praise
him.  This work was not known at the time.  Why?
And why was he able to keep it a secret?"
</p>

<p>
"He may have murdered all the workmen," replied
her father slowly.  "He was a singularly bloody tyrant,
according to the contemporary historians."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," triumphed Betty.  "And why would he
have murdered them, in order to keep this work a secret?
You see, he 'built the drain new from the tide-level,
probably to this point.  That means there was a drain,
but it needed repair, and he seized the opportunity to
hide his treasure.  Hugh, where are those tools?  I'm
going to get this stone out of the wall."
</p>

<p>
It was as hard a job as we tackled, despite the softening
of the mortar by the moisture of the ages; but after two
hours, Hugh and Vernon King were able to pry the slab
loose and it fell out with a mighty splash.  Hugh thrust
in the end of his crowbar, and it struck brickwork.  Our
torches showed this to be very flimsy, and when it was
pounded it rang hollow.  The three of us who had two
arms apiece went at it with a will, and I was dispatched
for reinforcements.
</p>

<p>
Nikka refused to come himself, but he sent Watty, and
the valet helped in the final act of demolition.  By the
end of the afternoon we had smashed through an embrasure
nearly three feet high and four feet long, and Hugh
nominated Betty for the honor of leading the way into the
dim passage which abutted on the hole.  The rest of us
crawled in afterward.  My uncle and Watkins boosted
me up, for my bad shoulder hindered me.
</p>

<p>
The passage was seven feet high and four feet wide.
It led straight back between brick walls into a large
chamber the roof of which was upheld by brick piers.  The
place was musty, foetid even, and very damp, but as our
torches struggled through the darkness the rays were
captured and juggled by glinting, sheeny heaps that were
stacked against the piers and walls.  Betty started forward
involuntarily.  There was a slurring sound, and then a
tiny tinkling that died away in a faint murmurous ssssh.
</p>

<p>
"It's gold!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
We flashed our torches right and left.  It was true.
Great golden piles sloped away from us.  The fragments
of the bags that once had held this wealth projected from
the multitude of coins.  At the end of the chamber the
piles mounted to the roof.  There were stray rivulets of
gold that trickled almost to the mouth of the passage.  To
the left stood several tiers of ancient chests.  The first
yielded at once to the point of Hugh's knife.  The rotten
wood cut like cardboard.  When he flung the lid back it
fell apart, but we scarcely noticed it for the dazzling
glamor of the gems that seemed almost to fight to escape
from their centuries-long imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
Jewels and jewelry and massive plate were heaped in
indiscriminate confusion, huge salvers, cups, chalices,
amphoræ, bracelets, armlets, amulets, brooches, necklaces,
rings beyond number&mdash;and running in and out of the set
stones, the endless profusion of unmounted gems, diamonds,
amethysts, rubies, opals, pearls, sapphires, topazes,
garnets, turquoises, emeralds, and others I could not name.
</p>

<p>
I picked up what had been a king's crown, a barbaric
headdress of crude unalloyed gold, red and soft, set with
enormous uncut stones.  Next to it was a chased bracelet
that might have come from the goldsmiths' shops of
Athens in the classic age.  The quantity of precious things
was almost inconceivable.  And this was but one of a score
of chests.
</p>

<p>
King stooped and scooped up a handful of gold pieces
from the floor, broad, finely-minted, bearing the
double-headed eagle of Byzantium and the busts and figures of
dead-and-gone Emperors.
</p>

<p>
"Was there ever such a find?" he muttered.  "What a
chance for the numismatists!  See!  Here is a Byzant of
Artavasdos the Usurper.  I never saw one before.  It was
not known that he had coined money.  And here is the
likeness of Arcadius, first of the Eastern Emperors."
</p>

<p>
Betty threw her arms around Hugh, as shameless, for
the moment, as Kara.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm so glad!" she murmured.  "It's as much as
you thought it would be, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh was dazed.
</p>

<p>
"As much?  By Jove, sweetheart, I&mdash;I never dreamed
of anything like this!  I&mdash;really, you know, I didn't honestly
believe in it before.  I used to pretend to make myself
carry on.  I told myself it was up to me to see the thing
through on Uncle James's account.  But&mdash;this!  I say,
Professor, how much do you suppose there is here?"
</p>

<p>
Vernon King swept his torch in an arc around the
chamber, the extreme confines of which were shrouded in
shadow.
</p>

<p>
"I am no fiscal expert, my dear boy.  It would take
committee of jewelers to assess those chests alone.  As for
the gold, I have seen the Treasury vaults in Washington,
and gold mounts up fast when you run into the thousands
of pounds avoirdupois.  Just as a wild guess, I might
hazard a minimum of $100,000,000, £20,000,000 at normal
exchange."
</p>

<p>
"But it can't be!" I protested, the sweat beading my
forehead at the thought.  "Why, it's ridiculous.  They
didn't have wealth on such a scale in those days."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, Jack," returned my uncle, his scholar's
pride aroused.  "You must remember that you are viewing
here the hoard accumulated by a Roman Emperor, one
of the last rulers before the definite initiation of the
Empire's final collapse.  It was then still by far the richest
country of which we have any record.  According to
Benjamin of Tudela, the Jewish traveler of the Twelfth
Century, the revenue received by the Emperor from the city
of Constantinople by itself amounted to 7,300,000
numismata, or in the neighborhood of $20,000,000.
</p>

<p>
"Benjamin and other later authorities, Andreades,
Paparrhegopulos, Kalligas, assert the revenue derived from
the remainder of the Empire to have represented five
times this sum.  At the most moderate computation, the
total revenue of the Empire must have exceeded $120,000,000.
It was probably very much more.  In addition, the
wealth of the individual citizens and nobles was
enormous.  The Emperor Andronicus, with whose efforts we
have to deal here, had two years to milk the country's
wealth.  During those two years, he not only absorbed
the taxes, but confiscated the wealth of more nobles than
any ruler prior to that period.
</p>

<p>
"I should not be greatly surprised if the contents of
this chamber was discovered to exceed $125,000,000.
Andronicus was possessed with a mania for accumulating
a treasure for rebuilding the Empire.  If he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you aren't very lucky, Hugh, you are going to lose
all this stuff just because you were lucky enough to find
it," said Nikka's voice behind us.
</p>

<p>
We turned to confront him.  Kara's dark, passionate
face was at his shoulder.  Her eyes drank in the picture,
and she stood on her tip-toes to whisper in Nikka's ear.
</p>

<p>
"No thank you, my dear," he answered drily.  "She
suggests that I give her my knife, and that between us we
clean up you people.  Oddly enough, she is not alone in
possessing that idea.  Who do you suppose is upstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Hilyer," I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Right.  But she's not alone.  She came back with Mahkouf
Pasha.  I've got them both safe under lock-and-key,
with Wasso Mikali's knife at their throats.  Still&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Out of the frying-pan into the fire, your ludship,"
remarked Watkins glumly.  "Sure I was this was too good
to last."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><br />
ANTIQUES, STATUARY, CHGS. PD., WITH CARE
</h3>

<p>
Reluctantly and with many a backward look,
we retired from that glimmering vault of wealth,
and climbed to the atrium.  We were all soaked
to the waist and suddenly conscious of the fatigue of the
last two crowded days.  Personally, I felt that I had
reached the limit.  I didn't care what happened.  I
thought that we were in a hopeless fix.  Vernon King was
equally morose.  Betty was ready to weep.  Nikka was
sardonically amused at our ill-luck.  Kara was indifferent,
so long as Nikka refused to embark upon a scheme of
wholesale murder in order to impound the treasure for
themselves alone.  Watty was tiredly hopeless.  Only
Hugh squared his jaw and said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have the precious pair fetched in if you like,"
volunteered Nikka as we sat about the room.  "But I
don't see the use.  I've talked to them, and I can assure
you they aren't in a mood to be agreeable.  Mrs. Hilyer
is consumed with revenge.  She isn't thinking of
anything else.  She just wants to get back at us.  Mahkouf is
politely threatening.  He figures that he has us on the
hip because of the killings last night,&mdash;murder of His
Imperial Majesty's subjects and all that.  He talked about
international complications, and lawlessness."
</p>

<p>
"Could we, perhaps, detain them sufficiently long to
permit us to get away?" inquired my uncle.
</p>

<p>
"With the treasure?  Hardly!  I say, do you realize
the sheer physical job in removing that stuff?  Why, there
must be tons of it!  It would have to be boxed and crated.
And where would you take it to?  How would you take
it anywhere?  To arrange for its removal would
require&mdash;oh, I'd hate to say how long!  In the meantime, we might
hold Mrs. Hilyer without causing any comment, but Mahkouf
is a well-known person.  He isn't called 'The Grand
Vizier's Jackal' for nothing."
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali appeared in the doorway at the foot of
the stairs that led up to the large chamber on the
courtyard level.  His face was grim and the tone in which he
addressed Nikka so savage as to attract the attention of
all of us.  Kara eyed him with approval, and ventured a
confirmatory nod.
</p>

<p>
"He says," Nikka translated, "that the only thing for
us to do is to kill Tokalji and the rest of the prisoners,
stow their bodies in the drain that I have told him about,
and then deny to Mahkouf that there ever was a fight or
that there is any treasure here.  He insists it was a great
mistake for us to take any prisoners, but that we can yet
remedy it in time."
</p>

<p>
"He's dead wrong," said Hugh abruptly.  "I think I
can use Tokalji to work out of this mess."
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Nikka.
</p>

<p>
"By making it worth his while.  He'd do anything for
money, wouldn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we have the money in limitless quantities.  I
want to say a word to you lads and Professor King that
has been on my chest ever since I saw that treasure-vault.
I never thought of this before, because I didn't take the
story any too seriously, as I've already said.  But now
it's beyond cavil.  My point is this: there's too much
wealth down there for any one man.  Professor King says
there may be $125,000,000.  Nobody needs that much just
to lead his own life in affluence.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to divide it equally between you, Nikka,
Jack, Professor King, Watty and myself, subject to
whatever disbursements Nikka thinks Wasso Mikali should
have and a price necessary to attach Tokalji's allegiance
to us."
</p>

<p>
"Your idea of purchasing Tokalji's aid, supposing he
can aid us, is a good one," said my uncle.  "But I have
more money now than I can use.  I must absolutely refuse
your offer so far as it concerns myself, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"Me, too, your ludship," spoke up Watkins.  "What
would I do with millions of pounds?  All the other
servants would be jealous of me, and the newspaper
gentlemen would be 'aving their fun with me every day most
like.  No, no, sir.  I'm an old man, and with all due
respect, I'm sure I'd much rather stay on with you at
Chesby, your ludship, and valet you properly.  It ain't
so easy to find a good valet nowadays, sir.  Really, sir,
I'd rather not."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Hugh, "we won't fight about that, Watty.
If you stay with me you&mdash;  Why, hang it all, you're one
of the best friends I've got!  You must stay.  But I'm
going to insist on splitting with Jack and Nikka.  Then
Jack can build houses to suit himself, and Nikka can play
his fiddle to poor boys and girls."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you'd make an offer like that, Hugh," said
Nikka simply.  "It's like you.  And don't you worry
about Wasso Mikali.  I'll take care of him and his tribe
with my share.  It wouldn't do them any good to make
them grossly rich.  They'd leave their old ways of life,
contract tuberculosis or dissipate themselves to death.  Let
them be.  They live an idyllic life, a life good enough
for me, anyway.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not going to protest against the corruption of
Tokalji, if you believe you can make anything out of it.
What is your idea?"
</p>

<p>
"Have him in," answered Hugh.  "I'll show you."
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali brought in the brigand chief, his broken
arm in a sling, a sour glint of hatred in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Hugh, "ask him, Nikka, if he'd like to be
so rich he wouldn't need to steal again, except to indulge
his sportin' tastes?"
</p>

<p>
Tokalji evidently considered he was being spoofed, and
he drew himself haughtily erect.
</p>

<p>
"He says any man would answer that one way," replied
Nikka.  "But that you seek to annoy him."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," returned Hugh, "that I'll give him £100,000
Turkish if he'll come over to our side, and back us
up against Mahkouf Pasha.  Explain to him about
Mahkouf Pasha."
</p>

<p>
The change in Tokalji's manner was ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
"He says," translated Nikka, "that he will kill the
Sultan for you for £100,000 Turkish.  But he wants to
see the money.'
</p>

<p>
"Watty," said Hugh, "go down into the sewer-treasury
and collect a sack of jewels&mdash;anything will do.  Tell
Tokalji I'm sending for an earnest of our good-faith, Nikka."
</p>

<p>
Avarice glowed in the brigand's face.  Wasso Mikali
looked disgusted.  He nursed some secret grudge of his
own against Tokalji, and had wanted to cut his throat
from the minute he discovered the scoundrel was our
prisoner.  But Hugh's hunch was a good one.  None could
doubt that as Tokalji gradually thawed under the
influence of his stimulated acquisitive instincts.
</p>

<p>
And when Watty tramped in fifteen minutes afterward
and plumped a bulging sack into the old thief's lap a
miracle was wrought.  Sweat beaded on his forehead; his
hands clawed the lovely stones; his eyes shone; he cackled
to himself and crooned like a mother over her baby.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him they are his, and that we will add gold to
them, if he plays fair with us," continued Hugh when he
judged he had made his effect.  "But he will have to
remain our prisoner until we leave.'
</p>

<p>
"He awaits your orders," Nikka translated the reply,
as Tokalji regretfully tore his attention from the treasure
on his knees.  "Wait a minute."  This last as Tokalji
burst into a tumult of excited speech.  "He says for you
not to worry about Mahkouf Pasha.  He knows all about
the Pasha.  He, the Pasha, has been smuggling arms from
Roumania to Kemal Pasha at Angora, and Tokalji has
played a part in the business."
</p>

<p>
Hugh just grinned, and the rest of us grinned back at
him.
</p>

<p>
"We are indeed fortunate," remarked King.
</p>

<p>
"Fortunate your eye!" returned Hugh with jubilant
disrespect.  "I knew such precious scoundrels would sell
each other out.  Now, Nikka, you tell Tokalji he is to
inform Mahkouf Pasha that he regards us as his friends,
inasmuch as we relieved him last night from the oppression
of a band of thieves.  And we'll have Mahkouf in here,
and give him an earful.  I suppose we'll have to drag in
that poor Hilyer woman, too.  I hate that.  But she'll
have to be made to understand her position."
</p>

<p>
The interview that followed was absurd and sordid.
Mahkouf Pasha, after an attempt at hectoring defiance,
collapsed completely and begged to be let alone.  Nikka,
who handled him, squelched him to putty, and told Wasso
Mikali to see him to the street.
</p>

<p>
"And remember," Nikka concluded, "if you dare to
breathe a word against us, you Levantine dog, we will
show you up for what you are to the Allied High
Commissioners, to your master the Grand Vizier and to the
Nationalists at Angora.  You have played all three of these,
one against the others, and all three will be glad to hang
you.  Go, before I kick you!"
</p>

<p>
Wasso Mikali positively chuckled as he jerked the
ashen-faced mongrel to his feet and steered him up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
Maude Hilyer was not so easy.  She began by a wailing
tirade that degenerated into a filthy harangue.  I learned
afterwards that she had risen in life from a position
which had made her engagement for the Gayety Theater
chorus an epochal event for her.  We sent Betty from the
room, and Hugh gently quieted her.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Mrs. Hilyer," he said.  "We don't enjoy this
any more than you do.  For what happened to your
husband&mdash;  Perhaps anything I say will be in bad taste.  But
the fact remains that we had nothing against him.  It
was he who went after us.  And I notice that although
that demon Lafitte tortured and attempted to abuse several
of us, including a woman, you never raised your hand to
restrain him.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not appealing to you on grounds of decency,
but of self-interest.  If nothing comes out about Hilyer's
end, you can go home and hold up your head.  On the
other hand, if you want to air what happened, I shall
see to it that the whole story of my uncle's death becomes
known.  Do you think that then you will be received
anywhere at home?  I leave it to you."
</p>

<p>
The queer social vanity that was the main-spring of the
woman's life responded to this argument.  She dried her
tears and restrained her tongue; and for a moment I felt
sorry for her.  But she showed her character at the last,
even as she rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"It's all very well what you say, Lord Chesby," she
whimpered.  "But what am I going to do now?  Hilyer's
dead, Little Depping is loaded with mortgages.  His cousin
George will inherit what's left of it, anyway.  And I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated artistically.
</p>

<p>
"I am not going to pay you blackmail," returned Hugh
coldly, "but you may call on my solicitors this day two
months.  What we do for you will depend upon your
conduct."
</p>

<p>
And that was the last any of us saw of Maude Hilyer.
But I may as well say here that she did call on Mr. Bellowes
in London, and that by Hugh's direction he arranged
to pay her a small income conditioned on good behavior.
Hugh, with his usual generosity, insisted, too,
upon making substantial presents&mdash;booby-prizes, he called
them&mdash;to our two Russian prisoners.  They were not
released, however, until we left Constantinople, as their
vindictive attitude assured us of their desire to wreck our
fortunes, if they could discover an opportunity.  What
happened to the strange pair after Wasso Mikali freed
them I do not know.  But I should hazard a guess that
while Mrs. Hilyer will be content to live respectably in
a cheap Brighton hotel, eking out her means with the
practice of bridge of an uncommonly sharp variety, Serge
Vassilievich and Sandra Vassilievna&mdash;whether brother and
sister, in truth, I never found out&mdash;will fleece their way
through the smart watering-places and resorts of the
Continent so long as the police permit them at large.
</p>

<p>
"Are we downhearted?" demanded Hugh, as the door
closed behind Mrs. Hilyer.
</p>

<p>
"We are not," returned King.  "It is amazing to
reflect upon the apparent hopelessness of our position a
couple of hours ago, while now we seem to have no reason
to anticipate any insurmountable difficulties."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too sure about that," I remonstrated.  "We
still have to consider the proposition of smuggling tons of
treasure out of a country that would be delighted to get its
hands on it."
</p>

<p>
"We'll find a way," Nikka declared.  "I feel more hopeful
than I did.  Hugh has given us a lesson in practical
strategy.  It was a master-stroke to buy in Tokalji.  Now
we have some time to spare."
</p>

<p>
"And with submission, sir, Mister Nikka," said Watkins,
gently closing the door behind him.  "Miss Betty is dead
asleep on some rugs upstairs.  'Ave you gentlemen forgot
it's past eight o'clock?  Come, now, a bite of supper, and
you'd best sleep a while."
</p>

<p>
"He's right," assented Hugh.  "We're overdoing it.
A night's sleep will set us all up."
</p>

<p>
We slept royally, leaving the guard duty to Wasso
Mikali's men; and the next day we awoke with confidence
in our united ability to overcome all remaining obstacles.
At Nikka's suggestion we called upon Wasso Mikali for his
advice.  He pondered for five minutes or so, then spoke
like a judge on the bench.
</p>

<p>
"A great treasure like this cannot be trusted in many
men's hands," he said.  "Otherwise I would offer to transport
it by mule-trains to the dwelling-place of my tribe.
Jakka knows how secure that is.  But even if we succeeded
in carrying it there, what should we do with it?  To make
use of it, you must carry it to the lands where you
live.
</p>

<p>
"So, friends of my sister's son, I say that you must put
the treasure on a boat, and you must go on that boat,
yourselves, and you must be sure you can trust the captain."
</p>

<p>
"But how can we find such a boat and captain?" asked
Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me," answered Wasso Mikali promptly.
"I know certain men of my race in this city who can furnish
me with information about the vessels that come to the
Golden Horn.  And in the meantime, you must make
boxes to hold the treasure."
</p>

<p>
We heard no more from him for a week.  He went and
came, sometimes by day and sometimes by night; and we
in the house in Sokaki Masyeri, prisoners as well as
captors, labored with saw and hatchet, hammer and nails.
As fast as we shaped the boxes, we carried them down to
the drain and packed them, wrapping gold and gems in
whatever fabrics we could find around the house, and in
this way we used up all the loose lumber, cloth and
bedding in Tokalji's store rooms.
</p>

<p>
Then, one night as we sat in the atrium, very sore as
to hands and fingers from the unaccustomed carpentry,
there was a knock on the courtyard door, and Wasso Mikali
ushered in a tall, lean man in a blue sea-officer's cap.  He
left this man in the courtyard, and came down to us.
</p>

<p>
"I have brought you a sea-captain who does not fear
to dodge the law," said the old Gypsy without preface.
"He loves a Circassian girl who lives in a street near
the Khan of the Georgians, and I have made it plain to
him that if we do business with him the girl stays in my
custody for surety of his honesty.  He is a Russian, and
his ship is his own&mdash;or so he says."
</p>

<p>
"You did not tell him what we wanted him for?" questioned Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him only what you must," counseled Wasso Mikali.
"I think I have a hold on this man, but I would not
trust him more than I could help."
</p>

<p>
"Why can't we tell him that we have made a remarkable
find of ancient statuary, mosaics and that sort of
thing?" I suggested.  "He will look us up, and the story
will sound credible for King.  We'll let him know that
the Government wouldn't like to see such a valuable
collection go to foreigners, and so we have to smuggle it."
</p>

<p>
"That will do," Nikka approved.  "And that will
explain why we must send the boxes aboard secretly."
</p>

<p>
We made the deal with the Russian captain that night.
He was not a bad chap, but a bit put to it to earn the
keep of himself, his crew and his vessel by reason of the
anomalous situation in which they found themselves, the
<i>Slava</i> still running under the old Imperial registry.  She
was a tidy tramp of 5,000 tons odd, and Captain Malakovich
made no objection to turning over the necessary cabins
for our use.  He expressed himself feelingly as glad to
help any one who was trying to diddle the Turkish
government, and he served us with a loyalty that earned him
a considerable additional honorarium upon our arrival in
Southampton.
</p>

<p>
"I'll enter your stuff on my manifests after we clear the
port," he said frankly.  "I don't care whether I ever
come back here.  As to Aleikouan&mdash;" the Circassian&mdash;"Wasso
Mikali can send her to Salonika when he receives
word that I have landed you gentlemen.  I'll trade with
the Greeks after this.  I'm through with the Turks."
</p>

<p>
The transfer of the treasure occupied a week, for we
could only work at night, carrying the heavy boxes down
the drain and utilizing the limited stowage-room of the
<i>Curlew</i>.  We set Watkins aboard the <i>Slava</i> to watch the
boxes, and the rest of us either mounted guard on our
prisoners or else made more boxes and packed.  It was a
hectic time.  The only real excitement that marked it,
however, was a visit we received from two of Tokalji's
men from the camp of the tribe in the Forest of Belgrade.
Kara took care of them, sending them back with imaginary
instructions from her father.
</p>

<p>
The last day, after the treasure boxes, now duly
stenciled "Antiques, Statuary, Chgs. Pd., With Care," were
stowed away in a secret compartment of the <i>Slava's</i> hold,
we all found time to go to the British Embassy to see
Hugh and Betty married.  Kara, strangely subdued in a
costume furnished by Betty, hung to Nikka's arm and
watched the ceremony with amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Do the Franks have to do all that to be married?"
she commented.  "I am more than ever glad I am a
Tzigane."
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with her, Nikka?" asked
Betty.  "Send her to school?  Or let me look after her?
I'd love to."
</p>

<p>
Nikka laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't very long.  No, I'm not going to curb
my wild hawk so drastically.  She shall taste of civilization
sip by sip, until it savors sweetly on her tongue."
</p>

<p>
"And you?" cried Hugh.  "Aren't you coming with us?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I must tame her.  And in taming her I shall
indulge the craving that has grown in me to sample again
the joys of the open road that I have not known since I
was a lad.  We are going to wander, Kara and I.  We
will go up into the Rhodopes with Wasso Mikali for a
while, and then we will take the Tzigane's Trail through
the Balkans and over the Danube and the Carpathians,
on, on, wherever we choose."
</p>

<p>
So, when the <i>Slava</i> steamed out of the Golden Horn
that afternoon, Hugh and Betty, Vernon King, Watkins
and I waved good-by to our comrade.  Nikka and Kara
stood on the pier-end as long as we could see them; and
after they had dwindled out of sight we turned our gaze
on the matchless skyline of Stamboul, with its lofty domes
and slender minarets and close-packed buildings tumbling
down the hillsides to the great cordon of the old Byzantine
sea-wall.
</p>

<p>
And on the very edge of the wall was poised the squat
bulk of Tokalji's weird establishment.  We could see it
clearly, the fine lines of the House of the Married, the
plumy tip of a cedar waving from its mysterious hidden
courtyard, and the L-shaped mass of the bachelor's quarters
opposite.  They bulked smaller at this distance than
when seen from the bobbing cockpit of the <i>Curlew</i>.  Already
it began to seem difficult to believe that within their
walls we had witnessed so much of tragedy and devotion.
</p>

<p>
"See, there is the mouth of the drain!" exclaimed Betty,
beside Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"D'you recall, Jack, how surprised we were when Watty
popped out of it?" chuckled Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Some day I really must return and follow that up,"
said King thoughtfully.  "Achæologically speaking, it
was quite the most important discovery that we made."
</p>

<p>
Watkins shook his head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"I've been thinking, Mister Jack, sir," he said.
"They'll never believe this story in the Servants' 'All,
'Awkins and Mrs. Prouty and Burbadge and the rest.
They'll laugh at me or arsk 'is ludship to 'ave the County
Council commit me for lunacy."
</p>

<p>
"They'd believe you if you accepted your share of the
treasure," I told him.
</p>

<p>
"Per'aps," he admitted.  "But what good would it do
me, sir?  I've no call for it, what with me valeting and all,
and in the end Lloyd George would get it, 'im and the
hincome-tax collector.  They will any'ow, sir!  By crickey,
Mister Jack, I 'adn't thought of that!"
</p>

<p>
And for the first and only time in the course of our
acquaintance Watkins indulged in a broad grin.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
